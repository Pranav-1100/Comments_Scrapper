Welcome to your LEAST BORING SUMMER EVER! Come join me at Camp CrunchLabs all summer long- <a href="http://campcrunchlabs.com/">http://campcrunchlabs.com</a>
Я тоже хочу
Боб пошел по тактике Архимеда
Your science level knowledge is great 👍
missed opportunity to have styropower do lasers
ลาวาแข็งแกร่งกว่างับ😂
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=894">14:54</a>, the satisfaction just hits like lava.

mark does not know how to use a bow
&quot;My X factor is a know device that pops popcorn&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s not an X factor, that&#39;s just making a snack.
You all together on a video is quite entertaining! Hope to see more like this in the future!
I learned physics without you

Let&#39;s bet there won&#39;t be 10,000 likes on this comment
can&#39;t believe Mark made a porcorn Shotgun🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=673">11:13</a> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<br>Later.. <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=675">11:15</a> WHOA!

Lava asmr💀
I honestly love how you portray science to kids. 💗
It&#39;s raining I&#39;m scared There might be a tornado
Kevin ruined your floor lol 😂
That&#39;s not popcorn. That&#39;s BOOMcorn.
Eventually, we will probably have very advanced lasers.  ( just a random thingy I said.)
Insurance company watching the video like &quot;uh huh, interesting&quot; 😅
Dude the very sad &quot;but I don&#39;t want that boat&quot;
Guys mark is 44 😢

Please mujhe crunch lab ka ek box bhej do 😊

I’ll tell my mom to go to camp crunchlabs
KEVIN IS!
Mark just looks so confused when william advertised his event <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=100">1:40</a>
Why not just a lava laser
한국어댓이없노
This was a bit repetitive

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=794">13:14</a> I thought it was going to be a microwave.
Myself
Duh, lava...it covers more area and its AOE (Area of Effect) damage is larger.
Can you ship a crunchlab box to Canada? (Alberta) if not it’s ok!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=757">12:37</a> the second I let my guard down proves true yet again
Kaylee and Squeaky were CLEARLY the MVPs of this video!
lava is always lava. But lasers can be scaled. The more energy goes in, the more destruction comes out.
Them bottles got turned into gojo
Pretty sure that&#39;s Kevin&#39;s lazer lol
Юмор намного лучше чем в &quot;разрушителях мифов&quot; , старых и добрых. Но сдесь для детей, а тоже интересно и весело !

I wonder how mark is going to top the destruction of camp crunch labs in this years final video
The cameraman needs a raise 100%

Mark Rober cast in the Thundercats movie confirmed
I love how as I watch this the view just keep going up
nerd
Bro is literally science mr beast now
That popcorn shotgun was so cool
I feel like you stole that from How Ridiculous
Mark doesn’t know how to calculate an arch
Why dpes he call science &quot; juicy&quot;

So, why is the ref pantsless? Lost a bet?

i would love to come but i’m in australia 😢😢
I had a dream about you where you were at our school and I met u <br>I think you also gave me a crunchlabs box <br>Was disappointed when I woke up 😂
Kevin did not consider shrapnel in that one....
&quot;By the way I got my archery merit badge in boys scouts&quot; <b>𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐬 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐭</b>

Concentrated heat and just heat
Марк роббер оставил пасхалку на Своффорда
Сэр, да сэр
For the popcorn one he could have made a hole in the middle of the pan and aimed the laser at it so it would heat the whole pan
Mark hello from Russia
Lava or acid
Parece anuncio de frijoles <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=760">12:40</a>
That would be great video if Mark Rober wouldn&#39;t be allowed 1000 miles near it.
А ты где катеры были ты достал мусор со дна?
Bro has a novritch scope on his laser🤣🤣🤣🤣 <br><br>Shoutout to all airsofters<br>Down with paintball 🫡🫡
Science question 🤔 - if farting makes one lighter, does coughing and sneezing change a person&#39;s weight? I should clarify,  I mean expectorating-type coughing.  Thank you 😊
BBBEEEAAANNNSSS
How do i make fire or somting 3000º ween i am a normal person💀💀💀💀
give b0b boat
Squeaky won. No competition.
last thing i expected was a lava tutorial 😂😂😂
Keep inspiring the younger generations to find joy in learning physics. I have a lot of respect for your knowledge and depth of physics while also being able to explain it in understandable terms and analogies to illustrate fundamental physics concepts. May you inspire future generations of engineers!

Hola Mar Robes yo soi Ariel y vivo en Cuba , yo estoi suscrito al canal y queria preguntarte si tus cajas de Crunch Labs podia llegar a mi pais

Hey Mark Grover can you find a way to whenever you put on safety glasses and puts you in a super safe suit from the glasses down to your toes😂 please I love your videos and pretty soon I&#39;m probably going to order a crunch labs❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤

A beam of laser slams lava anyday 😈
Я люблю тебя смотреть, но к сожалению я из России
Laser<br>Lava takes time to melt stuff, and cools down too fast to melt all the way through <br>Laser just burns through everything
I love how Mr Rober not only brings his own expertise and experience to the table, but also the expertise and experience of other great YouTubers and engineers

Purpose made popcorn popper was actually cheating though.
Mark Rober, can you talk about the Vina case which is currently viral in Indonesia?
난 한국인이다!
Hear me out if he can get his hands on a laser like that imagine what the government can get…then think about Lahaina, HI 😳😳
Türk varmı burda
whis video is so cool
СЕР ДА СЕР
hello
Ask the folks in Maui
the popcorn probably had some smelt stone inside
The safety profection is leveling up through each match. But for children to come, more solid walls and glass are definitely needed.
is it just me or does Mark sound like chris from total drama
Маймикс уже делал каток на маленьких шариках
You should make a video about cubing!!
Anybody who else would like to see Mark build a tiny robot out of electromagnetic actuators <br>👇
Mr breast!?
Bruh he just has lot of money
Hi
So, basically, this video is a test of the strengths and weaknesses of both a high temperature that is concentrated into a small point and a high temperature that is covered over a large volume? Got it.<br><br>Also, (SPOILERS!!!) totally predicted the boat and lava. I was even saying the trebuchet was merely a dumpster fire that was only going to boil the water (and maybe make a few fish fillets) but would completely miss the boat.
I wish I could go to crunchLabs<br>I am Mexican 😔🇲🇽
If i in Kazakhstan, could I come?
XD
&quot;My X factor is a know device that pops popcorn&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s not an X factor, that&#39;s just making a snack.
Water vs Laser!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1070">17:50</a> that was the most honest “in theory” ever😂
It&#39;s a pity that I can&#39;t play, I live in Russia
Everyone watching the lava: Woah, that looks cool!<br><br>The thermal camera: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
Haz un Rover pequeño y haz que aterrize
Kizaru vs akainu
You guys are insane!  ROTFLMAO
My dad has the same shirt as Mark
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=205">3:25</a> LOL. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=359">5:59</a> Whoa! That&#39;s impressive. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=758">12:38</a> Another whoa!
Isn’t laxer just light 🤔
That lava isn&#39;t cool with those bottles
Oh yes, you just walk in and you see three grown men playing around with spinning, katanas, and lava
340k likes in 4 DAYS!?!?! Thats incredible great work mark
粮食放大器
Is it just me or do the “bigger budget videos” just lose some of the charm that the older ones did.
Lava OBVIOUSLY won the maze. So it&#39;s a tie
“Non-lethal darts” is crazy
Oh come on Mark using an ancient chinese popcorn maker doesnt count
Anyone notice mark putting on some muscle?😭
I&#39;d like Mark and his music back pls.

声優変わった?
I don&#39;t like that you insinuate the ref is not wearing pants - it is not appropriate given you are marketing your channel and products toward children. It tarnishes your image as a family-friendly channel.
The funniest thing is William functioning as the safety expert. (Will I know you did it professionally)
Wouldn&#39;t a gamma ray laser be the most epic?
I’m never gonna be an engineer even though I want to be one

the crunchlab proposal is incredible but poverty is stronger xd
How many fish died in the boat challenge
I would do camp crunch labs but i dont have $300 to drop on it
Thanks for the content
<b>meanwhile the death star lazar: 🍷🗿</b>
but, i dont want that boat
Marks looking like he has a drinking problem these days.
Лол они тоже шарят сэр да сэр <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=645">10:45</a> 😂😂😂
Is it me or Mark has an explosive remote during the laser run on the boat? Seems rigged to me
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1415">23:35</a> out of context
This channel is the dream of all of us when we were kids and wanted to randomly destroy things.
Yeah mark, lava is actually hot.
Traducir texto con la cámara<br><br>Hi Mark, I&#39;m from Argentina. Is there a way for Crunch Labs to get here?
When William said, &quot;There&#39;s no way she&#39;s fitting in that maze&quot; I lost it. 🤣

Yes put lava on a very flammable material
can we get a shot out to marks table 🙏
Ok again PvZ music
Hey Mark that type of engineer you are?
yo why is mark looking built asf rn
i love how he did not even flinch when he made it explode at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1376">22:56</a>
<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/G8AfY6yWGuKuhL0PlbiA2AE"></a>love science and great vid
He sounds like Morty
Mr Rober, you alredy think to make a collab with other youtubers from other countries, like Brazil with Iberê Thenório, from the channel Manual do Mundo, for talk about something like the tower with wood by popsicles, or his own submarine (He made alone).<br>that would be so awesome.
Hi
he&#39;s the goat aka Mark Rober
“There’s no way she’s fitting in that maze”💀
You should make a bow and arrow like the bowling ball where when you lean, the arrow goes in that direction, and you give someone else an arrow and they lean, it goes in the exact opposite direction like the dartboard.
YOU NEED TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE A VID WITH BILL NYE😮🙏
Wow bro
Slt les gars !!!
For some reason when he said &quot;but... i dont want that boat..&quot; made me actually feel bad for him
The beans were waiting for you. they were ready to pounce
I would have use a cannon.
Mark Rober got mr beastified : (
I would go but annoyingly I live in england
Lava destroys Everything!
You&#39;re like the scientific Mr Beast

The hack pack the first robot. The motors aren’t strong enough to turn to Mark Grover. Look at this comment and get better motors for your turret hack pack robot because mine turns a tiny bit but then it stops and sounds like it’s jamming because the motor aren’t that strong.

This is the most American thing I have ever seen
Important question, will this event happen again?   I’m way too far away to make it this time but I’d love to go.
Mark I need your help
as you let your guard down L o l😅😅😅
photons can be stacked, atoms can not be there fore light can have infinite energy density and achieve greater temperatures
Who noticed the Russian meme.
Should’ve brought styropro out here he would love this

I am a FAN🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉,congrats on 53M BTW
I wonder if How powerful is gunpowder If it come to fight the champion in this video.
All you have to do:<br><br>just heat them up to 3000 degrees.<br><br>Yeah sure, you got me there, Mark. :)

Only made it to 10min in the video, just felt like a really boring video compared to previous ones. Only interesting thing was the popcorn popping thing. Other than that kinda just felt like a bunch of silly experiments that didn’t teach me anything
You and @LegitStreetCars should definitely meet up your both look a likes and it would be so cool to see him at your wear house! He’s a car engineer basically and your a builder would be a awesome friend to have
Hi Mark Robert

Lava may have taken last in the scoreboard, but it earned number one in our hearts !! Haha the bottles ... the spinning bucket lighting up the matches and the butane were all absolutely amazing to watch !!!  Awesome video!
I think I can actually FEEL the IQ points draining away. Maybe there&#39;s some sort of competition to make the most obnoxious video on the internet that I&#39;ve been unaware of.

Понятно
Okay; A lot of these could’ve ended horribly wrong for so many reasons.
Very cool. Everyone had some amazing setups. The spinning lave pot. The spinning katana&#39;s. And the Lazer boat I can&#39;t believe it did so much damage from such a distance.
This is something that @Brent Rivera can&#39;t copy

Laser may be hotter at times but it&#39;s concentrated and your targets can just avoid the light so easily but the moment they touch the laser they&#39;re just getting a hole in them. Lava may not be as hot as time but it&#39;s very chaotic and hard to avoid and one touch will give you a mild third degree burn but there&#39;s no guarantee that the lava won&#39;t hit you as well.
This will minimally affect the Trout Population
My boy mark rober putting some work in the gym like he does in the classroom!!!
@MarkRober so i know this is probably just going to get lost here because i am a nobody but i am from a no where highschool in mn and me and my friends have brought something to it that people thought wouldn&#39;t last called supermilage and it is a competition to see who can build the best &quot;car&quot; with the best mileage. This is something where we are versus colleges and if you want to know more just get a hold of me how ever you do that. Thats if you even see this. By the way love the vids keep them up.
Had to share 😊👍

If that was cool imagine a Veritasium (Science), Vsauce (Humor), and Mark Rober (Fun) Collab.
just ask the government which one they went with

Hello Mark Rober, I have a question, and if I am not from the United States, do the videos have translations or not?. And by the way l am translating this and greetings from Lázaro Cárdenas Michoacán México.
Am I the only one that expected mark to throw a hand grenade at the end?

Kevin sounds like Kermit
Ay mark im from winter program a month ago me and my best friend at school watch your video I love the hacked for those claw machines
Mark Rober asiendo que cada 2,000 niños se quemen a la semana
Possibly the best video I’ve ever seen
I just bought a helium argon laser! i&#39;ve wanted one since i was like 14.
&quot;Mr.beasts on scientific crack&quot;:
ah yes
It all has to do with the amount of energy in each. Laser @ 3000 watts is 3000 watts. Not sure how much energy is put into lava creation…. But it is huge.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=305">5:05</a> LAVA DEFINITELY WON! Look at the trickshot 👀🙃
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=463">7:43</a> &quot;there&#39;s no way she&#39;s fitting in that maze&quot; had me rolling
Kevin-“they’ll come back down any minute now” hahahaha
please turn off your video translations. They can&#39;t be turned off on the phone anymore and the german translation literally sounds really bad. It destroys the entire video.
William, where are your pants?
what if you dont pick the best one for the cruch labs
Hey Mark. The would love to get the monthly crunch labs box for my son. Do you guys ship overseas?
Mark please tell me when the next Allen pan video is I know you are friends with him

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=165">2:45</a><br>All you do is heat it up 3000 degrees
I get why you spread the love around, but clearly lava took like 90% of those.
William seriously isn’t even wearing shorts
Allow
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=462">7:42</a> when William said &quot;no way she&#39;s fitting in that maze&quot; 😂😂

I just watched this and I can&#39;t wait to show my kids when they get home from school!
I’ve watch for one min and I will already claim the best part is Mark’s Thundercats tshirt!!

before watching the video, I want to say this likely will not be 100% accurate as lasers will scale beyond the power capability that mark rober can produce. (will update comment if i am proven incorrect)
nice video, thanks mark!

Is this the Food Battle of science YouTube?
Here’s a comment that can only be described with “☝🤓”<br>Out of first assumption without actually watching, because I’m just like that, Lava is more feasible and larger scale, since there’s millions of tons of it on this planet, it has more wide spread damage, and lasers are an extremely strong small range device. But are a lot less feasible method. <br><br>I’d say lava

@MarkRober did you buy/borrow the katana blender from @howridiculous? love it when you two colab!
I think unstable dark matter vs lava would be very balanced, they next maybe?
very informative 😄😄
Why isn&#39;t there Forque 4?
ليه مفيه فوركيه 4
Why did the lava explode the beer bottles?
Mark with the no-look arrow shot...which totally missed! What a ridiculously cool, funny, (informative?) episode...loved it!
I hope everything is ok Mark, you look unbelievably exhausted compared to other videos. All the best

It&#39;s a pity that I won&#39;t be able to participate because I&#39;m Russian and I don&#39;t know. English
I swear that is not mark rober, to me he looks like an imposter
Lasers burning things and Hawaiian shirt, I wonder if there is a message here
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1147">19:07</a> is hilarious
So what about all the environmental destruction in the video? Literally littered the lake
Congrats mark - i swear you&#39;ve had the biggest jump from 20 mill to 52 mill i&#39;ve ever known.
Are you okay mark you look different ?
Lava matches 10/10 nut fail awesome stuff lol.

Ask Hawaii, I&#39;m sure they got something to say.
Mark rober my hero 🥲
Mom, I don’t want to eat my lazer beans tonight
“But I don’t want that boat” he sound somsad

Did they clean up the pond?
Just the usual racing show me videos

Mark could have used a microwave for round 2 🤯😯
I want to buy I can&#39;t because I&#39;m in Canada ...
Great vid - I think Kevin&#39;s lava colander was one of the most visually stunning shots of the vid.

This is like playing science as kids, but with a much much bigger budget
Bro got a holosun on the laser
Its not the beans you worry about, its the can sharpnel that can get you
It seems like Mark is turning into MrBeast now
Bro tried to do a rust raid with that bean can grenade
Broo recreated the aliens weapons from &quot;Battleship&quot; makes much more sense to me 😂😂😂
He’s ascending to Mr beast level
wait this was 2days ago? <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>cool :D but i think the video is better

Hello 🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🟪 it&#39;s me seb
I want the popcorn blaster for self defense 😂
Im not sure if Mark rober is letting the others win for some of these rounds or he actually is losing these rounds. Anyway, i feel like Mark has great plans that just forget about certain variables. Please dont take this as offnse Mark rober, love your videos
kevin boat?
Smash next question
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=757">12:37</a><br>All that&#39;s missing is Ann-Margret, with a bottle of Champagne. <br>Rex Beans... Fit for a queen.
Let&#39;s ask Hawaii... Survey says: Lasers. If you know, you know.
The katanas on the 1500prm motor - holy moly!
can you keep making videos like this i love them i watched this one 3 time already
I KNEW Mark would use that Popcorn maker!! I KNEW it!!!
cool vid if ur 11
hello
Lomo desde que yo no vivo en Estados Unidos 🥺🥺🥺
This episode has major Mythbuster Vibes.
Let&#39;s all be real that laser did not sink that boat
Awesome episode Mark and team!
I laughed so hard when he added, &quot;but I don&#39;t want that boat.&quot;
Is it just me but does mark look more jacked
mark lowkey getting some gains
I LOVE THIS AND I AM A HUGE FAN!!!😊😁😁😁😁  woah that glass and popcorn was really cool!!😮
Did Mark Rober Bloc Up
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=758">12:38</a> average post-Taco Bell experience:
for the popcorn, laser guy should have just lasered the pan. Also my x factor would be a microwave
he should keep doing these where the winners go against a new thing each time
Finally someone asking the real questions

Hi Mark
Lmfao when I saw the beans explode at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=758">12:38</a>!
I would have loved to have Bob&#39;s boat.
I honestly love how you portray science to kids. I have a masters degree in Chemistry and seeing the science in your videos honestly just makes me happy. Not many people are interested in science but with everything you do, I see how the kids can be intrigued.
“There’s no way she’s fitting in that maze”<br><br>Sometimes, Williams intelligence is beyond our understanding
Gman lazer omg
X factor brought a popcorn maker to the popcorn challenge
Wasn’t this done a while ago? I feel like I’ve seen this before
is mark more jacked than usual?
Bro the lake won
so what I learned from this video is that Mark and Kevin can&#39;t aim
Remember to eat fresh!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=556">9:16</a> Soffi Dossi!

Would love to see you do something related to the FIRST robotics competition
Mark Robers popcorn popping technique is the same way Malt O Meal makes Tootie Frooties!
Where is spyropyri
Laser.
I wonder what&#39;s better at making popcorn: lava, lasers, or a literal popcorn maker?
Mark I got one of your crunch labs box of the disc launcher and it&#39;s amazing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=893">14:53</a> has got to be the coolest part of this video. Beautiful.
Tú eres el amigo de mrbeast en el video de dónde salió kazuya abandonada
These men are smarter than I could ever hope to be. That’s why I felt so much pride knowing the popcorn from the lava was bad because you didn’t use any sort of oil.
GET @styropro IN HERE NEXT TIME LEGIT YOU&#39;LL NEED THAT SON OF A GUN
“I don’t want that boat” made me so sad
love ur vids
For the glass bottles I would have used and sledge hammer may not be cool or fancy but would it would have won

What is Williams shirt what<br>Also “don’t mess with a guy with a military grade laser” is not a threat nor a sentence. It is cool.
I&#39;m suing mark. I didn&#39;t get a mouse in my crunchlabs box 😡<br><br>Ovi kiding. Ily mark!
when i saw he beans i felt like a wanted to eat them there so yummy 😄

Olá, Mark Rober. Sou seu fã e moro aqui no Brasil. Quero muito te parabenizar pelos seus vídeos. E tenho uma pergunta pra você. Você entrega suas build box no Brasil?<br><br><b>****</b><br>English version <br>Hi, Mark Rober. I am your fan and I live here in Brazil, with my parents. I want to say congrats for your videos.

I love Mark, but I feel like he is increasingly targeting a demographic that I&#39;m just not a part of.
Alfin un canal educativo eh entretenido saludos desde puerto rico sin duda el factor X se necesita 🎉
Mark Rober perdón por hablarte español pero bueno nos podría bajar el presio de las entradas para ir al campamento esque acá en Colombia es mucha plata osea asi para los dolares son 24.95 pero para colombia son 700.000 pesos colombianos es como si fueran dolares serian 700.00 dólares y grasias por escucharme
love u mark@!
This is why Mark doesn’t have a fire alarm ❤❤❤
Mark Rober, please change your thumnail back

sad that the crunch lab toys (or enjeniring toy) cant come to ecuador:(
looks like lava lightning
These are some of my all time favourite Mark videos
The optic on the laser gun is hilarious😂

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1204">20:04</a> &quot;Launch lava at you, just like normal people do&quot; had me dying 🤣
This is both mortifying and beautiful at the same time. And really terrifying
hey mark, quick question about the camp crunch labs. do we have to be in america or can we be from canada,
I wonder how the lava and lasers would fare against borosilicate, or even quartz, bottles. My gut tells me that both would take a lot longer to break the bottles; it seems like the uneven thermal expansion is doing most of the work in this test.
I liked my own comment
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=900">15:00</a><br>the lava spiral is so cool
I thought this was related to One Piece, you got 2 pf the 3 admirals there, you could have added destruction by freezing and would have helped out a lot of One Piece Powerscalers
The lava sprinkler got robbed
“Smells like grandpa” 💀
Mark looking jacked
Finally
why does Kevin sound like Kermit?
.
I love the backyard scientist and William Osman appearances
I have a question, people from Colombia i can&#39;t do go to crunchlabs? 😢
Mark reminds me of the nice version of the host from total drama island
I love when you do showdowns. It is so fun to see fellow backyard scientists have fun with each other.

Hello Mark Rober, You probably won&#39;t see this comment but anyways, my brother loves your videos and does your CrunchLabs, and his birthday is coming up (early June) it would be the world to him if you just wished him happy birthday. Thanks for your consideration (if u do see this).
Hello are you engineer. It difficult job or easy please talk me ❤❤❤❤❤❤
This video with William and Kevin is so much fun, I love how they&#39;ve become regulars.
Dont know if you look more buff or fat? Im going for buff because I luvv you
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=645">10:45</a> СЕР, ДА, СЕР!
Why does it look like Mark has constantly just woken up from nap?
It’s funny how it goes two medieval methods and then straight up laser
It&#39;s raining beans🎶I love this sky Bea ea It&#39;s raining beans
Awesome that the cast iron survived lava!

ok.  this was a funny video but when watching the popcorn part, it made me think of a question.   Can you pop corn without heat?   what I mean is… in other words, can you get the external pressure reduced enough and possibly quick enough to get the internal pressure to pop the popcorn, but with out using heat?
Лазером надо было через все бутылки сразу светить
I get that for the challenge to work the beans were supposed to get warm, but some of us like cold/chilled beans. id say Mark&#39;s won for that
Theres no way shes fiitting in that maze! I love his hunour!

CrunchLab advertisement: boys and girls with different ethnicity.<br>Then main video: 4 caucasian men...<br>If the people that have large visibility do not try to change the society biases, who will?
I think i can&#39;t let to the Camp cause i am from czechrepublick And we do not have money for a trip to America 😔😔😔

I remember watching your pinewood derby car video back in the day I’m glad to see how you’ve adapted alongside YouTube over the years
There’s nothing more like mark then losing his own challenges two times in a row
i just thougt it was going to be kevin vs kevin
The laser guy did every one of these challenges in the least efficient/effective way possible. Lasers could&#39;ve done much better.
Acid Vs Lazar
i wish i could think like an engineer without actually having to be ome💀 calc and phys bruh
Love the red dot sight on the laser

This was handled so unsafely
Great video
Coucou les français
7.7 million views in 2 days? That’s impressively impressive💯💯
Me when I notice that Mark didn&#39;t even properly anchor:
In 10,000 years there going to find a crucible and obsidian at the bottom of a pond and there going to think we used lava as a weapon 😂
So many weird anomalies that happens during the Maui fires. Makes you think doesn’t it?
&#39;Why men lives less&#39; the video 🔥
That mouse reminds me of Algernon
another outstanding video!!
Очень круто, что функция нескольких звуковых дорожек позволяет смотреть видео людям со всего мира)
I swear william at this point doesn&#39;t even need a channel nor home anymore, he just teleports into other people&#39;s videos for a living
Ich komme leider aus Österreich deswegen könnte ich wenn ich das Ticket habe auch nicht kommen😢😊
!Вот что бывает когда есть лишние деньги и лишнее время, но скоро у вас эта халява кончится!!!
Give The scientist your boat
dude what is this question lasers go so far beyond what lava can do lasers can be one of the most powerful weapons and have uses

This isn’t related to the video at all but I just convinced my dad to get me the build box and my fist one is coming in a couple of days😄
Great visual popularization of science, very cool, greetings from Russia! I wish you up, guys.)
Destruction is very entertaining 😂
Well. I think @SortedFood used their popcorn maker wrong.

Well, considering lava can be formed into an actual RIVER OF BURNING DEATH.. Id say lava.. Hands down.

Nice!
It shouldn’t have been a question about bringing back camp crunch labs! A lot of people seen how awesome it was and didn’t have the chance to do it for their kids but now may be able too
I need Mark Rober&#39;s crew and the Hacksmith&#39;s crew to make a video together

I&#39;m not typically a Mark Rober fan but...... this I can get behind
I dont remember Mark&#39;s videos being like this. He&#39;s just not his original self anymore.
Wait a second, is it actually safe to consume these beans after their metal can get heated using an actual laser

Have you removed the cans of lavai from the water?
So much wastage of money, food, water, resources for the sake of nerd entertainment. Cool
Someone&#39;s been watching Sorted food.

Hello...

You know song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1393">23:13</a> ?
The laser had a red dot
I adore how Mark allowed William to be so disorganized. or to put it another way, him. Indeed, I have never witnessed a crucible simply shatter apart. That&#39;s crazy.

lava was robbed😭😭
For some reason I don&#39;t think that that boat was new once he had sunk it

Yeah no I am never going to attempt this reason I never win so there is no way I win and also it’s rng and I don’t have the resources to do this even though I am a kid and this looks fun but I don’t want to get my self excited just to be let down

hoping that you cleaned that lake afterwards
The x factor popcorn is literally how we make pop-rice in Taiwan 🤣
Matches lighting should have went to LAVA
Why don’t you talk in metric?
Shocked Mark didnt use one of those maze solving micro cars
&quot;Chef, yes, chef&quot;
You should make a very large 3D printer
FANTASTIC 🔥 THANKS ❤️
Sitting by myself and watching this on my phone, for the first time ever I started clapping at a YouTube video when the can of beans exploded, it was beautiful in its volcanism 😊
Засрали пруд только… вредители

Next time mark Hershey’s chocolate bar  with peanuts. Mice love it
It&#39;s the cool epic music that suddenly stops when mark misses the boat💀
Я надеюсь они убрали весь мусор из озера
If only mark was mr beats then u wouldve got the big boat🤣🤣
Yooo
Crunch labs is being delivered to Russia?
Perhaps nuclear can destroy it

Why didn&#39;t you use a metal gear ray like any average joe would&#39;ve 💀💀💀
Can we just tame a moment and see kevin just causaly pouring lava on wood
Lava&#39;s natural power is truly awe-inspiring. Great content!
I like Williams shirt used on a family friendly channel
Lava and lasers – two very different but powerful forces. Amazing!
Love from Pakistan ❤❤
Hey guys, welcome back to disrupting a natural ecosphere for monetary gain with Mark Rober!
🥱
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=456">7:36</a> bro i thought someone was at my door
Great visuals and explanations of the science behind lava and lasers.
Cadê a placa de 50M Mark?
The way this video explains everything so clearly is amazing.
Kinda was hoping styropo would make an appearance
So cool! But the lava not only destroyed the boat.. also the lake:(
The visuals in this video were top-notch. Great job!
Rober: cool<br>Rober in a Thundercats t-shirt: way cool.<br><br>Side note on the beans though; the goop the cook in is Uber hot, and will stick to the skin as it&#39;s honey and brown sugar, and won&#39;t wash off immediately. It can give you 2nd and 3rd degree burns. Aa me how I know.
rip floor
AJR🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Please don&#39;t turn into mr beast
This video perfectly illustrates the power of both lava and lasers.
thats crazy dude
I love the background music, plant vs zombie 🥰🥰🥰
This video was packed with information. I learned a lot!
lmao there reactions on everything sciency reminds me of sheldon,leonard,howard and raj
I watch with indonesia dubbing
I feel like lava should have won
😂😂😂
June 15 is my birthday 🎉🎂
stopped watching at 4 minutes. I hope WO lost a bet. At least knee level bro.
Lava&#39;s ability to destroy everything in its path is terrifying!
Hi Mark 👋
I miss the quality over quantity Mark
Mark looks older...
Will isn&#39;t allowed to participate for obvious reasons
A lesson in why catapults are not used anymore

That popcorn shotgun is possibly the coolest thing I have seen this year
Did they just destroy an entire pond ecosystem for a video?
Awesome video<br>Cool experiments<br>Lava was cooler, laser was more effective
needs more lava cannon
Ws in the chat for Squeaky ⤵️
OMG the popcorn shotgun was GENIUS
If you throw enough 5h1t the wall, something will stick.  This video contained a lot, and the one part that stuck was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=893">14:53</a> with the spinning lava.  It was great.
Mark is slowly becoming Mrbeast day by day
It would have been cool to see the mouse and the laser go head to head...for scientific purposes.
why in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=292">4:52</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=294">4:54</a> sound like a some anime moans behind the sound (Spanish audio) I checked other audios and there is not that sound @mark WTH here?
Lava recipe wow😂
Wow Amazing, Lava Vs Laser mana yg lebih menghancurkan wah keren
Love the thundercats shirt
Mark can you do a potion that will make me fast
@markrober soy pobre
The pop corn cannon is the real deal!
He did not fire that bow correctly. Honestly, I do not see much scientific merit to this video. The older ones generally had something interesting but this one feels…empty.
Bro those beans turned into the volcano
“But, I don’t want that boat” [crying emoji]
7 million views in a day 3 top in trending. Mark you definitely fell off 😢
Mark harnesses all the other YT scientists
Nothing a flex tape can&#39;t fix.
can someone tell that dude to wear some pants
Lasers are more powerful than I thought. Thanks for the insights!
The holo sight on the laser had me dead
Is will missing pants?
One super fundamental lesson here is dont ever wear a Tshirt longer than your shorts..😅
Love the video but one thing that’s stuck on my mind is that I don’t think it’s actually lava. Look I know it helps for the video but isn’t lava what comes from volcanoes and is mainly what surround the core of the planet?
The visuals of lava were especially captivating. Great job!
Nature vs technology – what an epic showdown. Loved this video!
“That would have hit it, but it missed!!!”    -Kevin

Half of my screen is covered by the products you are selling. How do I get rid of this?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=350">5:50</a> vn had many
“Laser vs Lava”. Not “Laser vs Lava vs Unlimited ways to finesse the system and tip the odds in mark’s favor”. And he still lost
I enjoyed learning about the power of lava and lasers. Great content!
Actually lava won because there wasnt even any lava inside for the last shot..i can bet you this that if the lava would have gone inside the boat it would have melted the inside creating a hole and makng the boat sink
looks like mark&#39;s been eatin&#39; them beans!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=34">0:34</a> [Cough, Cough]

heart wrenching to not see styropro
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=369">6:09</a> the other reason why this thingerythoo works is because the kernels cannot explode when they want to because they normally explode when the water inside makes enough pressure to break the outer shell and they can’t make enough pressure to overcome the high internal pressure of the thingerythoo
how about a lightsaber but the light is actually lava, so its like a lavasaber
I respect the thundercat shirt
Mark Rober is becoming a science Mr beast. (This comment has been verified  by the anti bot protocol)
Contamination? In the lake?  Where????? 😢😢😢😢😢
Should have brought a trebuchet
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=117">1:57</a> &quot;Non lethal darts&quot; 😃<br>&quot;Lethal darts&quot; 💀☠
the spinning lava pot is the most skech thing Kevin has ever done
&quot;I fired an error<br> into the air . . .&quot;
Obrigado por tudo Mark one.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1430">23:50</a> was so funny, but…i don’t want that boat….
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=118">1:58</a> is no one gonna mention “Lethal Darts” on the container
I&#39;m not gonna see the video because this one should be easy, they use metal to pick up lava, lasers can cut through metal, I&#39;m sure lasers could possibly cut through the lava... I rest my case.
The Spaghetti Swirls of Obsidian, The Big Bad Bean Volcano, and Mark&#39;s Manic Chopper Candle were the highlights of this video
Mark kind of cheated with the pop corn. It&#39;s literally designed to make pop corn.
depends how strong the laser is
Popcorn cannon is one of the coolest things I&#39;ve ever seen
didn&#39;t u do this b4?
Someone&#39;s a fan of world firsts.

They don’t have summer break in Australia but I wish I could come
hi
I absolutely love when Mark makes videos with the Safety Third guys
That popcorn contraption is actually genious
Bro why is my video playing in japanese or smth?
Okay, let&#39;s be real, Kevin definitely won the butane challenge when it came to style, between the flying lava and the obsidian remains.
&quot;It&#39;s an advertisement, Mr. Cole.  You do understand that, don&#39;t you?  It&#39;s not really a special message to you.&quot;
The trebuchet is a superior siege engine
Why don&#39;t you just ask Hawaiians?
These challenges and love how about you
Thundercats Ho!

@MarkRober and Alex from Legit Streetcars. We need a Collaboration between these two to prove they arent the sane person. 🤣
This is feeling more and more like a tv show. Not the vibe I want in a YT video.

I don&#39;t want to be that guy but do any of you guys think of the environment when watching this. I know mark has worked very hard to get to were he is now but i can&#39;t help but feel wrong watching this. I mean it gets the views but at what cost?
Pls do one with bill nye the science guy
Hello Mark, the little mouse would have won if you gave him another food, not cheese, they don&#39;t like cheese that much =), thanks and regards
Holaa Mark, el ratoncito hubiera ganado si le ponias otra comida no queso, a ellos no le gustan tanto el queso =), gracias y saludos

The visuals in this video were stunning. Great job!
DID YOU WIN A CAR???
Dang mark that was entertaining
THUNDER CATS SHIRT
pull the boat out of the water see how the laser sunk it
Mark must have started the jeff bezos workout routine
the one with the beans was funny because he said, when I got my guard down, it will explode, he let his guard down and exploded
The comparison between natural and technological forces was great.
The butane lava visual was cool AF as well.
The lava spinning on the matches event was an awesome visual!
MrBeast 2
La flame ralenti vraiment la flèche.
Theory: mr beast asked mark robber to do this for his next challenge. He wants to see if lasers or lava is more powerful<br>(This is just a joke, I’m not trying to ruin anything)
I enjoyed learning about the power and precision of lasers.
Même perdue, l&#39;image de la lave contre les allumettes,  une splendeurs !!!

There is one thing more powerful than lava or lasers…<br><br><b>Lava with fricken’ laser beams attached to their crucibles!</b>
ain’t that last part a felony?
William&#39;s shirt 😭
“You mind telling me what went down on that boat?”
lasers vs hydraulic press please
This is same as asking, which will destroy more, wind or water.. Well, tornado will destroy more than glass of water... And tsunami will destroy more than ceiling fan blowing some air.. If you have volcano full of lava, its definitely stronger than tiny laser.. But if you have glass full of lava vs. most powerful laser ever built.. Well..
Mark, do you still have the talking piano that played rush e? If you do then please make a short for it. I miss him.
&quot;But I don&#39;t even want that boat...&quot;
Ai Laik Fiit (guess the gibberish)
is it me or has Mark put on a little weight?? <br>love your video btw
1 day club <br>👇
please bro Bangla dubbed ❤
Laser gun has an actual gun red dot (Holosun). Now that’s some power 😮
Eres increíble
I&#39;d take my chances against a laser any day! Even those rust-removing lasers don&#39;t affect human skin. I&#39;d still wear the safety goggles though. 🤗
Why dose it look like mark has been getting plastic work done
lazer khá hơn so vs lavar bởi lavar có thể kiểm soát được bởi nhiệt độ thấp
Hi
“Who’s stronger Kizaru or Akainu”
isnt that a three-way tie?
How is Mark Rober the only wholesome/family friendly youtuber in existence that&#39;s actually entertaining?
Jiffy Pop Airbag prototype!
Hope they cleaned the lake after
Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk sou brasileiro amo seus vídeos
Scientific.. but with no real goal ahaha, I love this.
Is it just me or does Mark look tired. You doing okay @MarkRober?
people into archery know just ow pitiful your draw lenth is and lemme tell you its bad
YO NO PUDO POR NO VIVO EN  ESTADOS UNDOS
oh
Dang, I feel bad if there any life forms in that lake
That’s, you know, a question I’ve never asked…
The experiments in this video were so cool! Loved watching them.
Did u clean the pond?
Lasers are more powerful than I thought. Thanks for the insights!
1 Day!
Akainu vs Kizaru
This video made learning about lava and lasers so interesting.
Is it just me or Mark just change to a whole entire different language???
This video was both informative and entertaining. Well done!

Has anyone thought of the environmental effect of launching lava into a pond that has fish in it?
When my parents tell me to watch something educational 😂😂😂😂

No offense but honestly I prefered the videos with more scientific content, this has too much a vibe like MrBeast&#39;s and you&#39;re smarter
Borderlands has something to say about acid/fire(laval)/laser and their efficacy against armor/flesh ;D
“People look up to you mark” 😂😂
粮食放大器
Fun fact Mark. mice don&#39;t like cheese that much. They like Doritos and peanut butter better

Mark, I feel that you should build some hands that you can move or control to play any song on a piano 🎹 😊
LASER GUN
Havnt i seen this before ? Is the feel of this video. It just didnt grab me like every other video im sorry mark

Amazing video, the end was pretty funny 😆
It seems like last time with cars and this time with boats the small scale was so much more exciting, i guess know when to stop would be a better lesson.
Только это не лава 🗿
😱🤓🤔😁😂
Drake Anthony and Nilered are way smarter than anyone in these videos.
Me constantly while watching this video: So this is what happens, when you let the engineers be unsupervised.<br>They are even worse than the theatre kids.
Mark rober you are the best forever
this comment wont get 50 likes
Why haven’t I noticed how built mark is. His upper body and chest are so full
It is not about winning.  It is about entertainment!   Winning helps.
That katana spin was legit.
Bro is turning into Mr beast

Legislation in Texas to Stop Unknowingly Participating in Organ Harvesting<br><br>Tom Oliverson, M.D. is Texas State Representative.<br><br>Tom Oliverson, M.D. is Texas State Representative and Chair of the Insurance Committee, Texas House of Representatives. He first heard about forced organ harvesting through the Southern USA Falun Dafa Association. “There are a large number of Falun Gong practitioners in the Houston area where I live and represent, many of whom had been persecuted by the CCP. <br><br>“I have worked with both of these groups for several years to honor the victims of communism and recognize the horrors of forced organ harvesting, but our most significant victory came during the most recent Texas legislative session, when we passed SB 1040,” he explained. “Senate Bill 1040 is an attempt to prevent Texans from becoming unknowingly complicit in the act of forced organ harvesting. Senate Bill 1040 prohibits health benefit plan issuers from covering human organ transplants that are performed in China or in another country known to participate in forced organ harvesting and allows the commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services to designate additional countries who are known to participate in organ harvesting.”<br><br>Oliverson said Bills modeled after Senate Bill 1040 have already been heard in the Arizona House, Utah Senate, Missouri House as well as Idaho and Illinois.

Laser should have won the bean challenge ngl
i feel so bad was that actually his boat?? :(
Should ask the people of lahaina they know
Did mark really use a Whip-It butane can 😂

So, did the laser guy just prove the fires in Hawaii were started by a plane with  a Laser?  <br>Time to invest in blue tarps!!!!!!!!!!
I cannot stand advertising... I would like to sell you guys on skateboarding. Available everywhere!
Is it me or Mark sounds different?
ما هذا الرجل العاري
floor is lave NO <br>floor is bean YES
Idea:lava vs water
I haven&#39;t watched the whole video yet but I&#39;m betting on whatever crazy thing Kevin comes up with haha
Kevin’s lava pot spinning thing looked like a firework! Also, I bet his bean volcano was an eruption of flavor!
I really hope you cleaned up the lake after all your littering…
Is the laser beam being added in post? It looks strange. It&#39;s an IR beam, so not directly visible, but if there&#39;s enough crap in the air and power in the beam, it could hit it and make it burn/glow. Or the camera sensor could kinda see a little into IR?

THAT’S A THUNDERCATS T-SHIRT!!!!!
Mark Rober is slowly morphing into Mr Beast as time goes on and I don&#39;t think I like it ;-;

Cool
I want to watch this, but i got school work<br>Lemme just procrastinate like 15 minutes…
СЕР ДА СЕР,SIR YES SIR
Lasers will always win in the end.<br><br>It just depends on how powerfull you can make them.
The bean can was timed perfectly
Do we care if they cleaned the lake afterward?

Still the laser used in this video is child&#39;s toy compared to the most powerful lasers out there... The real powerful lasers are counted at millions of fahrenheit. This laser on video is only 17538 F
me sigue saliendo la pista de audio en latino, yo la quiero en ingles directamente
❤❤❤❤❤
How about a lava laser?
Ask Hawaii
Mark is slowly turning into an engineer scifi version of Mr. Beast and I&#39;m definitely here for it.. And I mean every second of it.

Ich denke ein idi wie mark ist das gefährlichste
Not sure about other places, but in China they do sometimes still use a larger version of Mark&#39;s popcorn cannon. I&#39;ve seen one being used myself, and for my parents that was the only way people sold popcorn.
who&#39;s the target audience for this
I was shocked it wasn’t styropro
Mark Rober etiqueto unos productos y cuando lo reproduzco en la tv me molesta porque ocupa la mitad de la pantalla no puedo quitarlo para poder ver el video. Alguien sabe como quitarlo?

laser wins easily all you need to do to beat lava is move away a metre
I want to assume Mark cleaned up the lake after all that but he didn’t say it in the video 🥺
As someone who has smoked a bunch of wax an is eating Cheerios on a warm n.c morn this video really jiggled my ninnies
we don&#39;t have REAL laser

Using a popcorn popper to pop popcorn? I mean, it&#39;s an unusual popper, but still.
About the first one, the slingshot, it must have a metal barrel with rifling marks around it, for more accuracy. (Also go for single shot, not like a volley ones, even though it looks cool)
Just here for the Thundercats Tee!

Isn’t that Kevin’s laser anyway?
virtual summer camp sounds so sad
i am commenting before watching but there is a limit to heat before it boils but you can get TERAWATT lasers which is orders of magnitude stronger but you know mark rober isnt a multi billion air to buy one so i say lasers if you could pick any laser
Should have had a scope for the first slingshot
THANKS FOR THE CONTRENT MARK ROBA😂 MARK ROBER
who had to clean up afterward, repair ceiling, repair floor, etc?

I think Mark(and Kevin) just made the best Bushes Beans commercial I have ever seen. To be honest, though that brand of beans does have some explosive flavor.

i disagree, the lava and arrows didnt even hit the boats, they stopped the aim, because they suck at aiming (sidenote: can i make a guys cant aim joke here?)
The mouse really screwed you over 😂😂😂

I honestly love how you portray science to kids. I have a masters degree in Chemistry and seeing the science in your videos honestly just makes me happy. Not many people are interested in science but with everything you do, I see how the kids can be intrigued.
I really want to know how to make the slingshot tbh
mark should have brought a ballista instead of a bow
I don’t think i will make it THIS Summer, but maybe next summer..?
Backyard scientist got robbed with the candle event
How do you even begin to quantise what is like for like with lasers and lava?  E.g what does 1kg of lava equate to in laser power? Lava has a variable temperature and lasers don&#39;t really have an upper limit in terms of power output, as there are naturally occurring lasers in the cosmos...

First time seeing someone actually use lava, instead of just molten aluminium or something. Dint expect any less from Mark ofcourse.
Needs more Allen Pan.

Never ever have I seen a silencer on a laser before<br><br>Edit: and a red dot
Forget playing with fire. This guy literally plays with lava for fun.

Lucky he didn&#39;t get that lava on his feet.
In Korea, your popcorn popping method is something done quite frequently. There&#39;s also a round disc version of it called &quot;ppong ti gi&quot; which is also an onomatopoeia for how it&#39;s formed. The ppong is the sound of the pop of the heating chamber opening and letting the popcorn product pop and expand!

„People look up to you, Mark“ - well, at least I used to. As much as I enjoyed your videos, explaining science and teaching to „think like an engineer“, the last videos were solely on demonstrating destruction without any real learning to it. There are enough channels doing this kind of content. We all know you can do much better than this.
Mark is a American Mamix
YOU TOP!

i feel like mark rober&#39;s videos are dumbing down, and transitioning a bit to videos like mr beast. More towards children, and less science/inventor type based.

Since when did mark rober become mrbeast?
with such experiments, you would have to do effects for films
wait how did you make the laser beam visible? Isnt that an infrared laser?
Stop trying to be Mr. Beast and be yourself.  Your videos building stuff, or science focused, are so much better than this nonsense.
this much funnier and more interesting than mrbeast honestly

I don&#39;t see pineapple skin in your list of things to test lasers and lava against.
Lasers, easily. They have an incredibly high upper limit to their power and lava is only as hot as its boiling point and however much energy the material can hold. I think it&#39;s obvious Mark knows this
Mark looks so diffrent, is he on drugs?!

If the force blowing from the mouths of 8 billion people were concentrated, what would be the power?

Is it just me or has Mark gone from scientific channel to just playing around and not explaining anything?

Loved this video
Hey Mark are you going to clean that mess u did in water bodies or just going to get forget about it cause u are the idol for kids to learn things
pulling a vacuum is not boiling the beans, it&#39;s just forcing air out of them
Kon kon mare Tara is video ka intazar  kar Raha taha
Very cool video!😀😀😀😀😀😀
Hi
This channel is no longer educational or informative..<br>lately the last few videos were just mind numbing, over the top ridiculous videos whose only purpose was to pull viewership.<br>Mark, you gotta do better buddy.

Your X-factor shouidln&#39;t count in this contest at all because this is lava vs laser, not lava vs laser vs other stuff.|<br><br>Real results, as judged by the stated objectives, Lava 2 Laser 6
I hope they cleaned that lake afterwards

Ok Mark, your archery merit badge requires 15 consecutive bullseyes from 3 different distances... this vide brings into question whether you completed that or not.<br>Also... I got my Archery Instructor Certification in Boy Scouts :P

the popcorn popper being called an X-factor was a disappointment. It&#39;s like using a rice cooker to cook rice and then calling it an X-factor!
&quot;Those are katanas, I believe&quot; 😂
Hope u cleaned that beauty
But i dont want that boat... 😂😂
Girls nothing to see here, just a bunch of guys enjoying science and being men in the wild.

Thumbs up just for the lava beans.
Question is, did they clean up the lake after doing all the test on it? Or did they just leave it there?
now do creative mode vs survival mode

Is it okay to eat lava cooked popcorn lmao
Melting the graphite crucible is a new feature I haven&#39;t seen on the internet before. That&#39;d be cool to look into further to see close up.
Interesting to see Lahaina’s two biggest enemies go head to head… lasers and volcanoes

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=288">4:48</a> Is it off gassing and then burning? Um yeah. That&#39;s EXACTLY how fire works! It burns the gas that comes off whatever is burning. <br>Eg, the log is not on fire. Its being heated by the fire, then the log releases gas, and then the gas is on fire, which heats the log, it releases gas, and it burns.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=530">8:50</a> mice also dont like cheese, you should have used peanut butter. mice liking cheese is a myth, its actually repulsive to them because of the smell, if they are desperate for food they will however eat it. the myth comes from someone accidentally looking mice in a cheese storage unit and then when he returned it was all eaten, this was out of desperation not desire for cheese.
That popcorn shotgun was glorious.
Fun fact: mice also dont really like cheese, theyll eat it if they dont have a choice but its not their favourite lol
I should have called Mamix too

quick question, how did the wood at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=206">3:26</a> not melt? or did it just look like wood and was not wood at all
😮🎉She exudes an elegant charm and carries herself with the grace and pride of a true queen❤️❤❤
Yea but lava didn&#39;t win last time tho..
You know I thought Mark was smart but when he said &quot;that&#39;s actually hot&quot; when seeing the lava my mind changed
I will never not love when you get the hooligans together. William Kevin Allen and Nile. It may only be half of the group but you still get my whole praise
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=803">13:23</a> Mark&#39;s beans have almost been freeze-dried.

Your judge needs to put some longer shorts or pants on. Looks like he&#39;s not wearing pants. Very odd choice for a channel kids watch.
I feel like f they need to adjust the puzzle or object used they should get less points or a deduction
Clearly, the final test was a test of aim not power.
Yooo
I can&#39;t go my dad won&#39;t let me
I love that Mark let&#39;s William be absolutely chaotic. Or in other words, himself.<br><br>And yes i have never seen a crucible just break apart. Thats wild.
Anakin Skywalker spent several minutes in a laser sword fight, then nearly died to lava. So, I guess lava is better.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1275">21:15</a> that must have been embarrassing😂💀

Aww, what a syphony
I really hope he does a short or whatever that shows the result of the others actually hitting the boat for comparison. It&#39;s a let down that we didn&#39;t get to see the result of a crucible full of &quot;lava&quot; eat through a fiberglass boat lol

Love this channel, not much talking just action unlike the slowmo one.
Mark rober fell off
The comedic timing in the Laser Beans segment was just excellent! 😆
Your lasers are crap.  You should configure them into a pseudo-bessel-beam, and make sure the photons are entangled before discharge.<br><br>You&#39;ll get much more efficient energy transfer from the beam into the object.
weak ahh laser
For the maze all the contestants should run at the same time!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=895">14:55</a> mark rober do you ok

So did you clean up all your mess at the lake or just leave everything at the bottom?

The floor is lava, and also the ceiling, and beans too
Who else can’t stop watching Mark Rober everyday
What happened to the refs pants?

Easy answer. Small amounts, laser, volcano, laser is a BB gun
Was I the only one who read it Java?...
I KNEW those beans were going to delayed explode.  LOL!  Yes!
Yeah military grade laser that’s hotter than lava available to anyone makes me nervous….
Who wins
Mark&#39;s been watching a lot of How Ridiculous with some of the parts of this video.
i wanna come to camp crunch labs
Won&#39;t this contribute to pollution and global warming?

So glad to finally see the referee costumes in their intended context. xD
The absolute lack of reaction to &quot;The floor is lava.&quot; I&#39;m disappointed!

Use to work for that butane company Whip-It. Just fyi wouldn’t buy from them🤐
Bro when he did the beans it  was floor is lava😂😂😂
YAAAA SUMMER CAMP
I swear William at this point doesn&#39;t even need a channel not home anymore, he just teleport into other people&#39;s videos for a living.
Thundercats Hoooooooooo!!!!
Espero aprender ingles para escuchar los verdaderos diálogos 🙂‍↕️
I absolutely love when Mark makes videos with the Safety Third guys, it&#39;s literally my favorite thing.
Wait what??? A new camp crunch labs??
thank for me to getaway body
❤❤❤❤
How do you manage to suck people in with craziness and still so smoothly teach actual science? Love these videos
Oof just watching Mark’s form when firing those arrows tho hurts 😅
The fish in the lake will forever remember the day of the fire from heaven.
this is way over edited &quot;contenty&quot; stuff for mark rober. We came here for quality videos, not over stimulating dopamine addiction zoomer content.
Hi
If they&#39;d simply moved the boat to where the lava first hit they&#39;d probably have hit it on the second try.

So the winner of the popcorn round was...  a widely available device for making popcorn?  Come on Mark, you can do better than that,
someday crunchlabs is gpoing to burn to the fround becuase of mark&#39;s experiments

A science video getting 2.8 million views in 10 hours?  I don&#39;t get it. Did Taylor Swift make a guest appearance?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=851">14:11</a> I know why they are colder than room temperature, because in boiling the beans using a vacuum, you are removing the higher energy bean material and leaving the colder ones behind, which is why he observed it as being colder than room temp, and rightfully so
lazer vs lava bro fell off
Lasers only lost because of lack of technology

Sorry mark but you can’t call the x-factor the “underdog.” They are confined to their subjects even in situations they know it won’t be effective but you can do whatever.

What about a lava laser
there is gonna be particle accelerator vs the sun
I too have my archery merit badge but can make distance shots easily
I wish I got 2.7 million views in the first nine hours after posting a video 😂
Mark Rober come here in Brazil in the state of Rio Grande do Sul because we really need your help with the floods and also in Argentina with the hurricanes
How to make lava: All you have to do is stick rocks in a graphite crusable then heat them up to 3000 degrees! Ez
isn&#39;t that Kevin&#39;s laser?

우리 대한민국은 파콘 기계라는 이름으로 사용하는 기계입니다
its awesome to see the camp stuff but i do wish that there was more stuff like that for adults. as someone approaching their 30s i dont feel welcome at the kinds of places that have these cool science toys. i know adults dont really get vacation like we did when we were kids but a no kids evening at a place like OMSI (even tho im no where near it) it would be something that if i did take a vacation in Oregon i would most certainly bend my schedule till it broke just to go to that. <br>i get that adults have the money and the freedom to &quot;do whatever&quot; but there is always that fear of &quot;but im an adult.&quot; and the expectation of &quot;you are an adult.&quot; that you cant just wave away by saying  &quot;you do you.&quot; or &quot;live your best life.&quot; expecially when there are kids around.
were there fish in the lake at the boat sceane?
The entire cast is a complete joke.

Test a blue roof versus a green roof. 🔥
Uncle Mark, can you make a water fan and an air purifier, because in Vietnam the heat is intense, especially in Ho Chi Minh City it sometimes reaches 45°C. We really need a water fan. but the spending amount cannot exceed 19.63 USD (500,000 VND). This is the challenge of the Vietnamese people.
I really like these kinds of videos

Mark rober didn’t make me what I asked him for. Gloves for people with camptodactyly. I am a person who suffers from it, and I would love to wear gloves.
‘I did a thing’ would’ve been a perfect collab for this video
lol that little 3kw laser welder is nothing. I&#39;ve used 24kw lasers that can melt through a couple inches of steel in seconds. fun stuff.
Haven&#39;t I already watched this?
I swear Mark is becoming the MrBeast of engineering
Shoulda pointed the laser at the bottom of the pan . Duh
ahhh just in time for dinner.

Very entertaining. 😂 Thank you.
The Butane lave was the most intense silly string I have ever seen
who needs protective gear when you can just drink a fire resentence potion
Ok Mark Rober is officially Scientific Mrbeast..
Nice Yolo
Mark has turned into mrbeast lol😂😂😂😂😂
Mark getting swoll tho
Mice don’t like cheese
im from argentina can i go to crunchlabs?
u crazy
I don&#39;t think a popcorn maker is the underdog in a popcorn popping showdown
how did u not get set on fire?
Okay Mark now you need to do a rocket powered by the butane cans you used in this episode.......I tried it years ago but I just lit the plastic injector and I am sure it was just the pressure of the butane inside that sent it flying because it didn&#39;t have much of a flame trail but, I&#39;m guessing you can figure that one out.
Should’ve used dragon fire laser 😊
sadly i cant afford the box rn
mark if you see this I am such a fan since the begining
Let me get the yellow like the mustard.
If acid can’t defeat lava can laser?<br>Edit: Laser wins!

&quot;that woulda hit but it missed!!&quot;
Im sad you didn&#39;t get styopyro as the laser guy...
How does the wooden table not burn from the lava at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=175">2:55</a>?
I&#39;m sorry but while lowering the air pressure causes the water to boil, it doesn&#39;t cause the beans to denaturate. (wich doesn&#39;t matter if the Beans are pre-cooked)
&quot;They are... swords&quot;<br>&quot;Those are katanas, I believe.&quot;<br>☝🤓
Спустя 20 минут я понял, что смотрю видео на иностранном канале, но с озвучкой на своём языке... Магия.
mark should make another video like this where one of his wildcard items is a gun
Power is power, no matter how you change it.
Has Mark Rober resorted to being just like how ridiculous?
So that simpsons episode where homer cooks a can of beans was accurate lol
Is this about maui
Mark je avoir les vidéos chaque deux semaines Pardon
&quot;Floor is lava&quot; did not get enough recognition xD
Can&#39;t believe you Knuckleheads vaporized all that toxic s*** indoors LOL

The pants got so short this time that at one point I thought he wasn’t wearing any

I tried to cook a steak once with a laser pointer. Wish I&#39;d had one of these haha
...
ah the popcorn cannon way of cooking it is great
I need help
for your shorts, I would love a couple of videos on all the damage the laser and lave did outside of their intended purposes. Like the cracked tile from the lava overflow, etc.
the glasses lasted longer than the titan!
I need help
This was way too fast paced. Might be better for rettention nowadays but everything was going way faster than tour other content. Our next generations are cooked
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=505">8:25</a> should&#39;ve used peanut butter.
why did the video play in another language until I refreshed it?
Keep going, hero 🎉
Nice vid
HOLA😂
I wish I could meet my favourite YouTubers irl but I live in east asia but I love your videos mark
Hi
When making popcorn with laser, how can you neglect to mention the movie Ral Genius? At the end of the movie, they direct weapon-grade laser into a huge aluminum ball filled with corn. They make enough to pretty much destroy the professor&#39;s house!
I feel like I got some life-changing content.
Holy mark seems so much older

Gotta love the thurdercats shirt.

The first boring video on this channel , we expect something great from you not this kinda stuff
The beans just jumping outta the vacuum
not the hard science i was hoping for but i was entertained
This is pretty sad, I miss the days when your vids felt much more organic, down to earth. Now it’s just a glitzy show for kids
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=332">5:32</a> this is actually something that was and is still very common in many parts of china :D
So no one gonna talk about maui wild fires…?
Mark looking swole
Hello
the popcorn maker designed to pop popcorn won? how could this be?

Put some weight on Mark, hope you’re ok
The boat laser looks like an infrared one, judging by the pink glare recorded by your camera. I really wanted to see what happens if he aims through the water at the boat fuselage!
Mr Beast copycat.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=140">2:20</a> gotta love how someone with a laser... a straight, more or less infinitely long line, that penetrates transparent things, decided to throw the challenge and instead of just cutting each and every bottle in a row at once, he takes his sweet time to cut targets 1 by 1<br><br><br>I guess it was most likely due to dangers of reflections and such, but still
The floor is lava literally
BEST VIDEO EVER
Uh..
I can&#39;t explain it but why does William not look like William???
뻥..뻥이요???뻥튀기가 왜 여기서 나와??
New One Piece video?
Let’s go to Maui and find out.
These Mark Rober videos are always chaos and I LOVE IT. 👁 👄👁   <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/jPgfY5j2IIud29sP3ZeA4Ag"></a>
Is it just me or is Mark looking swole 💪
loco creo que soy el unico el que habla español
Why i have feeling what im watching MrBeast video ?
Mark maybe try doing archery and u always look at what your trying to hit just saying btw
Semoga sampah sampah yang tadi digunakan di ambil kembali sehingga tidak menumpuk manjadi sampah.
flashbacks seeing marks thundercats shirt
😂😂😂😂
Nicely done!  :)
Kizaru vs Akainu
Estos son los videos que merezco
Can you creat an Electromagnetic Launcher for the fun pls ?
Those were some comedically timed beans
please clean up the lake :)
Wow
Thanks for featuring @ScienceBob, without this video I might&#39;ve never heard of him!
You should melt rocks into magma and try to recreate some of the ancient ruins with large blocks tightly fitted together.
Hello ❤
Hi
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=840">14:00</a> soooo you are serving cold beans?
W
The shot at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=905">15:05</a> makes it look like Mark and William are standing in a puddle of fire. It took me too long to realize it was just a barrier reflecting the matches
Я живу в России как мне к вам попасть
You did <b>not</b> just call beans tastier than popcorn!?
Hello🙂
William Afton 🟡🐰
You had one more arrow!<br><br>PUT THE TIKI TORCH ON THE BOW
Mark should’ve hired Oliver Queen for the final challenge 😂

Ok, you boiled 5he beana. But did you raise the temperature to cook them?
Thats not a new boat
The Flame from The Copter....Should have all of you walking in front of it.
But……..i don’t want that boat😢…
Appearing on kimmel isn&#39;t a brag...lol

i just realized mark rober is prob on trt therapy
Noooooòooooo   he&#39;s becoming mr beast
Remember when Mark Rober built really cool stuff? Those were the days
Can you do something with frogs?
Hi
Mythbuster vibes
Bro hired mr beasts editor
This will be muck better than your Lazer beans Kevin 2024 best quote ever
Thé mousse is me ?
Hi
Mark im disappointed, you used to care about the environment but now you’re throwing lava and arrows and boats in random water. The video is also much less entertaining than previous videos you have made. I know you’re more successful than ever but i rly look up to u and i expect more from you
That is alot of likes
Is it just me or is Kaylee kinda bad?
Шеф да шеф
Marks video are becoming lower quality
한국 뻥튀기네
Dude uses a popcorn maker and wonders why it makes the most popcorn
Someone is on roids…😂
They’re basically How Ridiculous at this piont
New mark rober upload dropped yippee
The only thing this video did was make me laugh and want beans
Me supporter laser
Mark Rober casually doing all this stuff when I wouldn&#39;t have the brainpower to drop figure out how to press a button to drop the can at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1099">18:19</a>

This Was the coolest science experiment I&#39;ve seen.

A laser will always be more powerful than lava if you want to, simply because you can put in infinite amount of energy into a laser. Maximum energy you can put in to lava is to the point where it vaporize.

thé bow just wasn’t powerful enough
Why is mark like a nice rick from rick and morty 😭☠️
I live in Indonesia if you make a video it&#39;s still night here 😢
I wonder whether they complete a risk assessment for every experiment, which is was a proper institution has to do legally.
I like Lava more

Combine the two, laser strike a volcano to make it erupt and destroy your enemies… Maybe I have a little too much Bond villain energy.
I actually expected a mad genius device for the final X factor. A remote control boat with explosives, a devil&#39;s toothpaste with a remote detonator, even a viking funeral<br> boat with a hay valento catch a flaming arrow.<br>I was sadly disapointed.
Kevin is the best

Never hire Mark for your viking funeral hahah
Should have brought in Todd from Todd&#39;s Workshop to fire some more historically accurate style fire arrows, rather than the Hollywood idea of them ;)
Is it just me, or has Mark Rober turned into Mr. Beast?
Hoo
You crazy mark 😅
for a smart engineer like mark rober youd swear hes never heard of a parabola before
Perfect

I JUST REALIZED THAT ITS SUMMER! WOOOOOOO CAMP CRUNCHLABS!🎉🎉🎉
I am offended by this crime against beans.
Lava hasn&#39;t destroyed a planet. A laser destroyed Alderaan.
Have you ever felt the indoor kids just don&#39;t do anything and don&#39;t get to do it with harsh parents
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1435">23:55</a> but… I don’t want that boat 🥺

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=45">0:45</a> this gun laser Strongly resembles that of the movie « pixel » with Adam Sandler when they fight against giant caterpillars
Squeaky was edging the maze.<br>lmao
2 million views in 6 hours...
When the crucible ignited the boat it wasn&#39;t by sheer luck. It&#39;s a highschool-level projectile physics problem. The loaded crucible fell just nearly short by about 20 ft or so. Reducing the mass of the projectile while keeping the launching mechanism consistent will result in a projectile that flies farther at a reduced speed. I remember this from 8yrs ago when I took physics in high school. Pls explain the explanation, and not sensationalize an explainable outcome by calling it &quot;sheer luck&quot;, because it&#39;s not luck, it&#39;s physics.
The lazer should&#39;ve win the beans
Its amazing how Mark can get 2 million views in 6 hours
Mark looks exhausted.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=189">3:09</a>. The real question here is HOW THE FRICK DID THE WOOD NOT CATCH FIRE

Never knew mark rober was in boy scouts
all the tests are a bad way to see what is better
Hi ❤<br>👇
&quot;It&#39;s a katana (nerd)&quot; to a former teacher who plays with lasers
It&#39;s so sad to see one of the best science channels on YouTube turn into MrBeast style crap content.
$300😢😢😊
As soon as I seen Kevin I knew Willy boy would make an appearance

Did you know a trebuchet can launch a 90 kg object 300 meters? Just saying.

Is it just me or has Mark been hitting the gym?
thanks
Can a laser become more powerful than that?
Me voy a suscribir ❤
I&#39;m sorry but I thought William wasn&#39;t wearing any pants😭😭
I love everything you do Mr. Mark. You are the best!
The roast were insane jajaja I love it
No joke, how hot do you have to get a crucible like that for it to break?<br><br>That was honestly the most impressive thing that round.
Real life &quot;The FLoor Is Lava&quot; gameplay

Lasers of course just look at Maui. With lava they dont even blink there.
Too much beastification. Love ur science based videos but ones like this one is not your best style of comtent
Styrpyro not being consulted is a travesty.
This video in a nutshell, profits first safety last
Lol gg
Thumb down because of the german audio that does not sound like Marks voice. Its really confusing, knowing his voice and all of a sudden some german speaker comes along.

Yooo! what’s up mark, long time no see!

why is it a foren languige for me

Okay did anyone else notice that one William went to get the reff uniform there was two boxes one marked non-lethal darts the other marked lethal darts
Mark. Your profession is my dream in life, being an engineer, But i can’t understand what type. Or imagine what courses you took to get to your point in life. Im praying you see this.
Real genius popped popcorn with a military laser over 30 years ago

Why is it German?

&#39;And the floor is lava&#39;<br>lmao
Hi
😊😊😊
mice are lactose intolerant, aren&#39;t they?
I&#39;m a little concerned that the guy trying to teach me physics aimed straight at the boat with the bow and arrow with no consideration for mass of the projectile, wind resistance, gravity and distance to target.
ScienceBob is one of earliest nerds on youtube.
I feel like mark rober videos Are loosing that special something that they used to have
Hi Mark, asking for 95% of the worlds population:  How much is 3000 Fahrenheit in reality?
Lava vs. Butane = Satan&#39;s Silly String
“Don’t play with fire!!”<br>These guys:
I thought Kevin’s spinning pot was gonna be a let down, I thought the lava was going to be way too viscous, I’m so glad I was wrong
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=893">14:53</a> that is the definition of Genius, it made my day
Eres un grande Mark
That beans on the roof would make a cool art piece with a canvas haha
I mean look at what happened to Hawaii ….
Me, knowing exactly where that katana trap came from
Williams shirt goes crazy 😂😂😂
As Hank Green has taught us.  Water is lava, so Kevin did hit his boat with lava.  Just not enough to sink it.
&quot;That would have hit it, but it missed&quot;<br>that touched my heart, so deep and meaningful
I wish the videos would go back to being more about making a cool engineering project rather than a set of Mr. Beast-esque experiments to get an audience hooked.

anyone else realise he forgot to wash his hands so the alarm went off
Me waiting for the LavaLaser in association with IARPA 😅
But the real question is: does rocks float on lava?
how much safety stuff did you bring in solely for the butane canister?
Why are you wearing the Thundercats shirt?
I love these collabs with the science youtubers!
Explosive beans

next time you use a mouse, try tempting it with a chocolate bar
Great video!
Le cambiaron la miniatura we
Was that not a bean can pipebomb for a bit? Like is the top of the can enough of a point of failure for it to always break in that way? Could the can not just become shrapnel in certain scenarios that weren&#39;t controlled for? or was a small point of failure like in the video always inevitable? I&#39;m sure you guys did things safely I&#39;m more wondering why my idea of the risk of that one thing seems off.
DEAR LORD tell me he mis-pronounced &quot;suh-WARDS&quot; on purpose.
<b>Facts:</b> Lava has a temperature greater than 900C° between 1600C° which can be irritable when connecting with other matter. Every minute that passes, the lava becomes carbonized because it is a gaseous matter.
“But… I don’t want that boat…” 😅<br><br>😂😂😂
Wasted time. Watched it on rewind.
Huh not bad
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1186">19:46</a> The fish in the lake: How hot! 🥵

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=766">12:46</a> can be like a bean commercial
i really hope you cleaned up that pond. with divers and all
These slo mos are better the 4-5 current videos of slo mo guys videos
my guess is that lava wins because lasers are actually quite weak, just focused in 1 point
Mark is really trying to get us back in 2017 with those videos 😅
let, go
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=440">7:20</a> Mark is turning into a girl! 😂😂😂

Thunder thunder thunder cats on the loose
Lava wins easily because a lot more things were ever destroyed by lava and very little by laser cause lava is natural
Coffee or Tea?
the way he said &quot;but I don&#39;t want that boat.&quot; made me laugh so hard

That is not mark robor
What logo is mark wearing on his shirt?
crunch camp sounds great, but if i were to do an idea, what if it was knocked off or i knocked off someone without knowing?
mark, you used to do fun content
This is before I picked lava
That lava pot was so cool
Lava still the best
You don&#39;t have to be a nerd to know those are katanas, you just have to know that nerds are obsessed with katanas.
Best mark rober video yet!
Sure hope that Cronos camera is waterproof...
This may be your funniest video yet.
Backyard Scientist using inferior siege weaponry is why he can&#39;t sink boats.
I am a simple person I see laser and lava in video and I click.<br>Needless to say I like this video.
I don&#39;t think the earth has ever been ravaged by lasers 😂
Mark, Leave Hollywood out of you videos and preferably out of your life.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Video probably inspired by what the government did to Hawaii.
Greetings from Mexico mark, I admire you too much and I love your videos but this time I have a challenge for you, what do you propose to counteract global warming and support Mexicans?
Boring Video.<br>Everything is so Predictable and has been done before,<br>so I have literally seen everything except a can of beans in a vacuum camber (which I don&#39;t regret)<br>Had to Zapp through the video didn&#39;t even watch it.
Next week on Mark Rober: How long is a piece of string 🤦‍♂
never tought i’d hear Laser Beans
I love these videos. Bringing in the extra guys like Kevin and William make them even better. Thank you Mark, so awesome!
Awful editng.
It&#39;s raining beaaans!! Hallelujah!
I just noticed that William wasn’t wearing pants
Incredibly bizarre! 😂😂😂🎉😂😂😂❤
Ok, but where can I get my own popcorn cannon?
Why is in chinese
I don&#39;t know how Mark gets to keep calling himself &quot;the underdog&quot; as the laser and the lava are kept under restrictions while Mark can literally just use the actual tool for the job like the popcorn popper.
&quot;I wanna be covered in beans&quot;<br><br><br>.....yeah.................or hit with shrapnel 😅😅😅
As a pest control specialist, <br>Mice really don&#39;t like cheese. That&#39;s a stereotype created by cartoons. They&#39;ll eat it if cheese is there and they&#39;re hungry. However, it&#39;s not their first choice. <br>The other variable being that was a pet/domesticated mouse and not a wild mouse.<br>You should have simply used peanut butter.
Hmm. Well this is funny. But When will there be more really scientific and interesting things?
This has a very “How Ridiculous” feel.

What if Kevin had HIS laser on one hand and the lava on the other 😅.. I&#39;m just curious which one is more powerful, Kevin&#39;s or Bob&#39;s.  But it was nice to have an outsider in the video (not in the same friends circle). I also love how the whole vibe of the video and Mark change once William is on it,  he brings chaos.And I love it.
Can I win one of your mark rober products 😁🙏🙏
Hawaii was Subject to both
Love seeing TBS participate! You def need to collab with more of the scienceTubers!

I genuinely adore that these three can be so childlike over this… I mean, I totally think it’s cool and grinned, but the sheer awe and laughter in their voices because they understood more of what was happening is great!<br><br>Edit: On the flaming arrows. You should totally get say, Todd from Todd’s Workshop on to do something with the historical ‘flaming’ arrow mixtures, that stuff is scary and cool, and totally beats the ‘modern accelerant soaked soft head’ thing used here and in films.

I hope that was a quarry lake, kinda hard to tell in the video (which is awesome, by the way !)
Oh, please deactivate the atomatic speech translation in your vids if possible, it feels so wrong to hear a german version of your voice.
UNO is worse

Is this the guys from Fortnite
i like how they put a gun red dot scope on the laser in the last part
Its always a day when Mark Rober posts
Not a laser. It&#39;s super inneficient.
Even as an adult (granted an acknowledged nerd and geek) that camp looks and sounds AWESOME

Mark has been lifting! Don’t feel bad about going up to that XL size! Triceps as big as the brains!!!

Enjoy watching 🎉
the german voice-over is just bad...
hi
&quot;All of the power of a volcano versus these beans.&quot; Is not a sentence I was expecting to hear today. Or ever.
William Osman is about as funny as Jimmy Kimmel... who is not funny at all.
Mark really pulled a “I Did A Thing” with those katanas
Wow 1millon tan rapido (susurra) aunque mrbeast lo supera
The floor is Beans?
1 499 009 просмотров за 5 часов.
bonus points for giving the laser a picatinny rail
the way the lava slid across the floor tho i always thought it was sticky
Mark forgot about the relationship between pressure and temperature. So, by pulling a vacuum on the beans, or lowering the pressure the temperature will fall too.
Tiếc 3 chiếc thuyền quá. 😢

&quot;But I don&#39;t want that boat!&quot;
this video is so funny thanks mark rover!

Its awesome
Make it yourself lava, perfect for kids under 8. XD
A can of beanz can serve as an explosive.<br>Noted.
Где русские?
спасибо, вы очень интересный канал! <br>от души за все ваши видео!
We have officially lost Mark to the Mr. Beast content style catering to little kids with tons of flashy lights and effects to keep giving them dopamine until the video is over. <br>Rip.            👇
I love how he says that it’s strange that no one has tried to make popcorn with a laser while William actually did do that
See you again in 6-12 months
I am kinda sad about the mrbeastification of this channel
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1188">19:48</a> we&#39;re there any fish in the lake you put lava in?
This is one of your most fun videos... and I was legitimately concerned for your safety at certain points.
Cheese is actually bad for rodents.
If there&#39;s ever a round 3 we need to see a water jet cutter.
2018 mrbeast crew but scientists 😂
You used something that is purpose built for popping kernels and called it an underdog lol

Great video mark❤❤❤ 😊😊 you rock!!!
What did we learn?  After lava experiments, Crunch Labs needs a new floor.
Pretty nice 👍😍

He&#39;s literally science MrBeast at that point
this is a great video
You reaaly got to give it to kevin&#39;s insane creativity.
Porque le dieron el punto de los frijoles al de la lava, si solo el del laser pudo hacer frijoles comestibles
This was actually way more cinematic than I expected. Great video)

Amazing video !<br>Thanks a lot for all those crazy experiences !<br>Hello from France !
The king has RETURNED!
This is very skibidi
WHY IS IT IN ARABIC
I dont know how i feel watching Mark becoming increasingly more chaotic after working with William and Kevin more and more.
THE THUNDERCATS SHIRT GOES CRAZYYYY
bro had one undamaged boat and gifted the one which sunk.
the mr beastification is almost complete

I hope you cleaned the lake after.
You know, I&#39;ve always wondered how high your insurance bill is. Gotta be at least 5 digits a month.
Bro, 6 hrs from posting and you alrdy got 1 million views?!?! Geez bro
lava has a limit before it becomes a gas. lasers do not.
What happened to this channel?
imagine future geologists just finding obsidian in a lake
I FCKING LOVE DEATH LAZERS FROM SPACE OMG

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=251">4:11</a> I seem to recall Tory Balleci from Myhtbusters saying &quot; We&#39;re cooking popcorn with lazers.&quot;
Hi
Today I learned a new greeting from William. Usually people say <b>&quot;hello&quot;</b> in various languages, William says: <b>&quot;It smells like farts in here&quot;</b>
The X-factor popcorn is one of the greatest things I&#39;ve ever seen. 🤣
Imagine if popcorn machines worked like the one Mark presented...
should have brought syro pyro
Надеюсь мамикс будет участвовать<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=100">1:40</a>
You can&#39;t thread a needle between children and adults to save your life Mark, but kudos for the kids.
lol that offhand and offscreen comment &quot;the floor is lava&quot; XD
J&#39;ai le seum je suis français
thanks for wasting so many resources on bullshit. Climate exchange is for the others, not mark.
Can of beans is just adding lava to lava.
disappointing to see you devolving into the Mr. Beast style of videos
Shoulda gotten the kid with that 3megawatt laser.  He built a freakin&#39; mount and a scope for his.
Popcorn shotgun
Next challenger should be sturopyro and his eletrical shenanigans
Видел смену заставки, все как ты и говорил
I live on an active volcano, lava will always win.

Best video I see on my fup „again“!
Por fin otro video ❤❤❤
make  popcorn gun
woah
&quot;why hasn&#39;t anyone thought to use a laser to pop pocorn?&quot;<br>Megamind: ahem
I like this video❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=645">10:45</a> отлично, Свофорды, ваш папаша готовил вам яичницу по утрам?
The beans!
Mark you chose the normal way to pop popcorn…
Why is William wearing such zesty shorts bro 💀
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=249">4:09</a> Fun Fact: styropyto in fact has tried to pop popcorn with lasers in his video about turning microwaves into laser ovens.
Mark, you been workong out?😍
Mice aren&#39;t interested in cheese ....they prefer things like chocolate/biscuits/breakfast cereal.<br>The only mouse that ever really liked cheese was jerry from tom and jerry 😛
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=340">5:40</a> guys go check out what happens if you put crayfish in this kind of popcorn device😂
&quot;don&#39;t insult a guy with a military grade laser&quot; I feel like that&#39;s smart
<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/G8AfY6yWGuKuhL0PlbiA2AE"></a>
For a sec I thought that he just redid the cover of the other video of acid and lava😅😅😅
I have a feeling that all three of these guys are secretly pyromaniacs
too much attention to the youngest people, so content now is not watchable for grown-ups.
I love your videos mark!!!
Imagine how much cooler it would’ve been if the backyard scientist used the superior siege engine (AKA the trebuchet)
اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد ❤❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=165">2:45</a> PVZ REFERENCE :0
These are my favorite collabs. It&#39;s a ton of fun seeing Mark work with others with a large passion for science like this.
Lava boy ate!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=772">12:52</a>, guess alongside triple reinforcing the ceiling, it also needs to be bean proof now.
Mark Rober, you never fail to inspire me
For popcorn I would have used laser but had the popcorn in oil and pointed the laser at the oil
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=757">12:37</a> I love that
Every like this comment gets I’ll do 5 pushups

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1437">23:57</a> why he say that so sadly 😭😭
All-shirt-no-pants William is my new favorite character
One day Mark, an engineer is going to invent something, and perhaps they&#39;ll get asked how they got started in engineering...and they&#39;ll say &quot;Mark Rober and Crunch Labs&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t that be a legacy!<br><br>Awesome content as usual! I&#39;m certain that many young minds are influenced by you.
Hi
Bro this inteo mark is crazyyyyy keep making bangers like this dawg
Hi
&gt;-&lt;
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Mark Rober is like Mr.Beast for kids between 8-12 instead of 4-8.<br><br>This is the era of sensationalism I guess.
thx for vid :)
Урааа ааа!!! 🎉❤❤❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1328">22:08</a>when Mom said, if you miss, you kiss the girl. The same Mark:🗿
Soo... Did he clean up the lake?
❤️
did you clean the pond?
I feel bad for the people that have to clean up after this nonsense.
How many international fans are here to support Mark Rober?✋🏻
Mark should have called @JamesJeantrickshots for archery support
Next video: Which is stronger; Biggest nuke in USA&#39;s arsenal or Biggest nuke in Russia&#39;s arsenal?
Team Lava
You have to bring I did a thing on lol
It was literally raining beans 🫘 😂 it was awesome
I don&#39;t want to be that guy but I really hope that lake was cleaned after the video, don&#39;t liter lakes people
Yo hi Mark, I&#39;m just a bit worried about that lake and those carbon emitions... did you at least clean that lake 😭😭😭
Но есть же катер Робера, он целый 😅
His insurance agent watching this episode --&gt; 😳🤦‍♂️😰😨😣😫😵😭
как жалко что марк в америке😢
Shine a laser on lava- you get lava.<br>Pour lava on a laser- you get lava.
Do a triple threat with Lava, Acid, and Lazers.
Gives 1 dollar perfect
🎉😮😮 wow super
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1317">21:57</a> sorry mark but your no Hawkeye 😅
William is the highlight of these videos
Please, if you use the AI voiceover - just put it over the &quot;i do not speak&quot; audio track.<br>Else it sounds like those bootleg russian movies where a depressed speaker (who had plans in his life but dubs films just released) speaks over them.
Someting about this video feels very mrbeast
Bug bites and poison ivy build character.
Epic 🤯

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=650">10:50</a> RIP can of baked beans. You will be missed. I shall meet you beyond the pearly gates.

Mark Rober—The BEST science teacher EVER! I would’ve loved science even more than I did if he was one of my teachers, sorry Mr. Kayda, and I joined the military after high school. Science is life!
Yo
But I don’t want that boat😂😂😂😂

Love you from Antarctica
Is it me or does Mark look more and more like Seth McFarlane every year?
“contaminar un lago” el video
Who will clean up the lake after the boats?
How do you even clean up spilling lava on the floor
Really shows you&#39;ve been working out,<br>Lookin solid 💪💪
WILLAIM’S SHIRT IS BEST
Yoooo, i want that popcorn chamber thing!!!
why does this video just feel so odd and different.
i dont think the lava is fair in the first test becouse it coult effect multiple bottles at the same time while the laster had to do it bottle by bottle
Maybe those Laser conspiracies are true after all lol
not even 4 hours and 3k comments💀
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1432">23:52</a> knew it from the beginning lol

Mark would have done better simply throwing a grenade into the boat... still... awesome effects all around.
I miss mark rober before the beastification of youtube
haven&#39;t watched the video yet but its lasers
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1097">18:17</a>It&#39;s a helicopter😂😂
Bro the part about popcorn Chinese cooker with Kevin and William grabbing each other and shouting is actually hilarious.
👉🏻LOVE💗 FROM INDIA.......💗💗💗<br>👇🏻Ånyone here from India give your attendance

Bruh how did your subscriber count double in 6 months
So we had to grab a can opener (casually, a grenade goes off)
Bob&#39;s the best 😂
Best channel ever
true
That&#39;s what you get for using the baby laser on the maze instead of the 3000 W beast.
Today I learned a new greeting from William. Usually people say &quot;hello&quot; in various languages, William says: &quot;It smells like farts in here&quot;
It seems Mark Rober has tapped into the amazing revenue potential of <i>Homosapiens sapiens</i> of less than 0.1 centuries of existence. I mean, this is kinda silly, not that scientific but it has all the hall marks of an highly efficient wherewithal operation.
ui lâu r mới thấy ra vd
this is the boats in time
Hombre ver llamas, hombre ser feliz
Lasers will always win when you pump enough power into them
Mark: what!!  u get a hug??
We need to see lava vs squeaky challenge
Hi

Mark has become too sensationalist, probably due to spending too much time with Mr. Beast.
Could you test imonium nitrate and stump remover, I heard it’s an explosive surprise with a fuse

I&#39;m on the other side of the world at 2:11 AM<br>still watching your videos
Root bean float
How come that all but 1 flaming arrow puts it self out as soon as they leave the bow? To much wind speed or drag maybe? But I wonder what made the one arrow keep a flame? Was it shot at a lower speed? The video does not show... I wish more data!

its called lava vs lasers not lava vs lasers vs x factors
did they clean up the lake?
&quot;theres no wayu shes fitting in the maze&quot;  how did nobody laugh at that😭
Mark needed to watch Tod’s Workshop for some fire arrow advice
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1444">24:04</a> Russian YouTuber Mamix has already conducted such an experiment, “a skating rink made of plastic balls.”

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=207">3:27</a> did that wood just survive lava?
Love your channel, content and passion, but as a lover of all things related to catapults, I have to say that the &#39;spoonapult, was a bit of a let down and a perfect example of why they&#39;re terribly inefficient. With a proper sling, Kevin might have won that round and possibly the competition. Curse you Saturday morning cartoons for skewing our historical perspective of medieval siege engines!
WHERE IS STIROPYRO??????????????
I&#39;m surprised Kevin didn&#39;t come up with &quot;Laser is one letter off of LOSER!&quot;
at exactly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=465">7:45</a> ksp wasm done booting up and it seemed so nautral with that music
I wonder how many Crucibles Kevin has destroyed
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=900">15:00</a> was one of the best shots I&#39;ve seen in a while! Bravo!
Марк Роберт я понимаю то что ты не русский человек и я должен тебя ненавидеть но я желаю и всем американцам и украинцам счастья❤

This is my most favorite episode by Mark ever 😂😊

La pollution ????
Mark trying his best to imitate Edmure Tully.
Is that a mrbeast video?
i like that there actually using real lava instead of metal
Love u mark

Did you know? Lava is Liquid mineral meaning that water is also lava.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=645">10:45</a>.....:)
mark lets goooo!!!!!!!!!!
я огорчен что лазер доверили человеку, который не умеет им пользоваться. там есть специальные насадки для зачистки металла, применение которой во многих раундах было бы разумнее
team lava
At least you didn&#39;t spill the beans.
Why is the first comment a bot?
Amazing video!
You know, I have one simple request, and that Is to have sharks with frickin&#39; laser beams attached to their heads!
Its crazy they use actual lava- most molten stuff you see on you tube is molten metal, which is no were near as hot.
This content just exudes bad reality tv vibes now.

The Holosun on the laser lol
In today&#39;s episode of &quot;Kinda Scientific&quot; we learn that popcorn made in a popcorn maker is better than popcorn made without a popcorn maker.

I love William he so funny
Big greetings from Russia 🇷🇺
Indonesia mana nih?
hmm
Mr. Miagi can &quot;cut&quot; glass beer bottles better than a laser.
If you do this again i wanna see an FRC robot as one of the x factors
The arrow didn’t work because the material on the head was parachuting the current which was pushing it backwards
That was sad for l😕asergrandpa:(
I feel like Mark Rober videos are just turning into MrBeast videos.
lava because it can be used as geothermal (volcano likely) source to power the admitted existence of DEW weapons, 2 openly deployed as anti air wepaonry
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=757">12:37</a> Mark, tell me honestly. How much does your cleaning crew charge?
yay!!
Did anyone clean that lake afterwards?
first 1m less go

Was this for the people of Hawaii? Lava vs Lazer.
remember back in the day when touching lava meant instant evaporation
Робер! Шеф, да Шеф!!!!!!!
How long did it take to clean up all of these science experiments? Crunchlabs got absolutely wrecked by those beans!
Один из самых интересных каналов которые я смотрел на всем Ютубе

Acid vs laser?
Teach us devils toothpaste ❌<br>Teach us how to make ACTUAL LAVA ✅
Mark Rober es sorprendente
This is crazy😂OMG
P.S. because I am &quot;that&quot; guy, they did use a laser to pop popcorn in the movie Real Genius. Granted, that was a movie though so you guys absolutely win. BTW, thanks for another fun, informative video!
Hi
Mark R  is so  cute with his silly experiments. I love it 😍
Brasil
My challenge would be flying car safeties.
should&#39;ve used the UK DragonFire
William Pooh-bear Osman.
Kevin&#39;s beans. Just like an episode of M.A.S.H.
I feel bad for your local fire department XD
i wish i could be in that camp crunchlabs thing but im too far from where it is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=685">11:25</a> XD
Mark keeps luring us late millennials back with William and Kevin and I&#39;m totally here for it
Lava vs. Laser vs. why Mark joined. One day, someone will get injury hurt.
i love how guy holding his finger off the triger at laser. just like people with real wepons
These are the best

Given there was a small room with a flammable gas in it, I feel the need to ask a question.<br>Did anyone loose an eyebrow? 🤨
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=469">7:49</a> какой милашка🥰

Mark, do your boxes ship to yemen
&quot;Cloudy with a chance of BEANS&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1176">19:36</a> thats some hard bayer pattern aliasing in the tree background and that line in the lake :D very cool, you could do an episode on that :D

Thank you so much!! I love you Mark. And the fact he told us how to make lava 🤩😝💖
Lava &amp; Lasers insta click
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=251">4:11</a><br>&quot;Cause it&#39;s a no-brainer, just like you.&quot;<br>I&#39;m using that whenever somebody talks about making decisions now.
Love you Mark. But if @idathing was there, that video would have been  half as long. Love that guy
how can i turn off the audio dubbing by default?
Sadly i live in germany
Jwx to see what you can find for you sure 😄
Hi
very fun video
this video in short: WOOOAAAAAH!!!
I can also have a blast playing mc or fortnite all summer
Каток без льда уже сделали Марк это был Мамикс
Laser should have won the beans because it actually did the most damage.
&quot;But i don&#39;t want that boat&quot; just a little boy stating his preferences
why did u do the first experement on a wood table?!?!
I think you should watch styropyo when it comes to lassers cause he doesn&#39;t disappoint
cheese 🤤
did mark go crazy with botox?
This isn&#39;t even the first video I saw with a popcorn canon this week. I saw Barry Lewis scare the crap out of himself with one. They do seem pretty scary.
Gonna be honest, my favorite part is Mark wearing the ThunderCats shirt.
How and why were boiling beans cold?
i&#39;m glad that mark has his own dr. nefario
that was soo cool if you are a kid watching this kind of stuff

Dang when the lava hit the water it didn’t make cobblestone 😭
allan Pan next!
Why don&#39;t you do rain versus global storm and tidal wave next time? How do you come up with such silly topics with silly titles designed only to monetize silly posts? Couldn&#39;t you better occupy your time your resources and your know-how and talk about things that are not so silly?
why am i pinned (mark please i wanna show off to my friends mark please)
Mark Rober is like the Willy Wonka of science

I honestly found the fact he decided to use a can of beans to test them, alongside a boat. This is typical Mark Rober behavior, lol.<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hf90Xv-jHeOR8gSxxrToBA"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hf90Xv-jHeOR8gSxxrToBA"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hf90Xv-jHeOR8gSxxrToBA"></a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=159">2:39</a> The synchronization of that was impeccable. Each visor falling down exactly one after another.<br><br>However that archery on the other hand... really wasn&#39;t.
No es por ser mala onda pero limpiaste el agua donde se hundió el barco 😅

Why is this being translated to German, and how can I make it stop?

Sorry Mark... But when it comes time for me to be sent on my way to Valhalla, I&#39;m gonna make sure someone else is the archer.

Well if the laser was aimed straight from the side of the bottle instead of in front...all of them would have been cut in half in no time

“Former middle school teacher” I’m trying to stay quiet…
Bro this is the most unfair video I’ve ever seen
LOL Nice video <br>A can of Baked Beans in a camp fire is a GREAT way to heat the baked beans <br>But FIRST you cut the top off part way <br>30 years ago I found out a friend didn&#39;t make any cuts on the top of the can <br>I had lots of bean shaped burns on my back from flying hot beans after the can exploded
Mark Rober plus a bunch of jr colleague science magiciancs equals some of the best content I have ever seen anywhere
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=644">10:44</a> СЕР ДА СЕР!
Bring Nile red back! 😢
hello
Merci pour cette vidéo incroyable.
Imo the recent videos have fallen of. Might be me getting older, or just a change of target audiance.<br>Its more MisterBeast style and less science focused. Wish it would be more about learning even for people who are 25 or something. So you when you close the video it doesnt feel like you wasted your time.
Shouldnt there be a control on input energy?
Bro this videos are super cool mark youre the best
I&#39;m a big fan of Marks content, I just love Mark&#39;s personality. He reminds me of my favorite science teacher, Mark  pretty much looks like her and even his personality and his laugh.<br>Love you mark❤

Hi, science Mr.Beast!
Marks video quality has severely reduced recently.
You should make a self solving Rubik’s cube
They put a red dot oj a literal laser sight.
Props to you for including multiple audio tracks. GGs
bjr es que la box et dispo en france
Bro think he is Mr Beast
The science teacher totally called it with the mouse being afraid to leave the maze.
I appreciate this edit so much. Incredibly hilarious work!
Mark rober is next Mr beast of science 😊
Сэр, да, сэр!

I think the difference is lazers can do everything from a distancee
Kevin and his lava are a little nuckin&#39; futz, but the katana spinner was terrifying.   I love watching collabs with a few science and gadget guys.
“MY CEILING!!!!!”
id loved stryropyro on this video

I love how William and Kevin have become regulars, this is such a fun video with them
Nah no way<br>Not having styropro on here for the lasers is a crime

Legendary video, cool concepts, nice boat.
Mark has either been hitting the sauce lately or he&#39;s on steroids
How Ridiculous proved that with enough centrifugal force the katana will break off it&#39;s handle and fly in any direction... those handles are only held on with a peg of bamboo... have fun with the information...

I can&#39;t stand watching your videos anymore, the beastification totally ruined it
Come on mark you don’t care about the environment
Lava moves slowly.  The &quot;SPECTRE&quot; laser is immediate.  Happy trails.  ;)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=161">2:41</a> such a mark thing to say
Hows about Lava powered Lasers ?
Did you clean the lake?
I LOOK forward to mark Rober videos its the best part of the month i wish he did like 2 videos a month
This channel was better before it was Mr. Beast and so tightly directed
I would love to see a collaboration with ElectroBOOM. We have lava and lasers, how about some raw electricity?
These YouTubers gotta stop blowing stuff up in the water their is no way you clean any of it up
This is very refreshing video
Science Mr Beast is at it again with peak content
did mark rober copy the gregtech (new horizons) soundtrack?
notice the power of the laser lol
Yo is mark getting yoked?

Hey Mr. Science, there are few people like you in this market, so I wish you success.

I feel like Mark should be disqualified from the popcorn competition, because he used an off the shelf product.
Mark firing a projectile at a line of glass bottles:  I guess he learned something from How Ridiculous when he collaborated with them.

the lava spill looks cooooool<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1032">17:12</a> the alien eggs are hatching

after the popcorn, i was half expecting mark to just bring out a pan and burner for the beans. i mean, he just used a popcorn maker.

It’s a pity that I won’t be able to get the crunch labs designer because I’m from Ukraine(
I LOVE YOOOOOOOOOOOOU I am from colombia :3
The mad scientists at work .  Love it and iam 70
I would have used one of my family heirlooms on the glass bottles, my great×8 uncle is sir Isaac Newton so I would have just knocked them off and used gravity, easily the fastest time lol
not a tri-hull!!
All these smart people and no one calculated how far the boat needed to be to get hit from the catapult
Is it me or does mark look like he aged 20 years since his last vid

Love love spinning lava!
Mark please stop making mr, beast videos. 😭😭
Seeing that the floor is always lava and never lasers, I&#39;d say lava wins.

Lava also releases toxic gasses and spreads exponentially. Gotta imagine lava has it in the bag.
The fact lasers went from fun cat toy to drone death ray is peak humanity.

Did Mark gain a lot of weight or I havent watch him in sometime?
How to hours ago
This is so so cool and so are you.

whats the popcorn thing he used?
The GoPro 🦾🦾🦾
The Popcorn X factor feels like a medieval torture device
SUIIII HES BAKKK
Благодаря этому эксперименту государство Америки будет теперь навязывать как именно свою свободу в военном плане они за это искренне благодаря
I was hoping one of Mark’s X-Factors would be friendship
Жаль я не могу попасть в этот лагерь ☹️
I like you❤❤❤
Ain&#39;t he shouting way too much these days?
he doesnt want that boat
Lol
Unbelievable scenes 😮😮
the metal 1000 kernal popcorn maker exploder was very unexpected and its probally so unsafe and unessesarry but im behind it yeehaw
He&#39;s just appealing to the largest demographic.
Ah yes, the existential question we have all been pondering for so long!
They should try to recover the lava that went into the water. I bet it&#39;d look cool
I love william cameos, theyre the best.
It always interesting seeing William as comedy relief
No shot the beans exploded 😂😂
I want 1
This content is not it

Kevin should have just put the pan over the lava for the popcorn

Kids who get the Crunch Labs boxes have the greatest childhood ❤

Too bad I can&#39;t go, I&#39;m from Mexico and I don&#39;t have any money 😔👍
Imagine if you had just been kicked out of your home had nowhere to go so you enter marks little competition and are told the winner gets the boat you then completely dominate every round just to find out the boat that you just sunk is your new home 💀

&quot;But... I  don&#39;t want that boat.&quot;
Hello Mark rober,I am Russian,Can I write in Russian?
Marc has been bulking up! I see you Marc!
2 hours is crazy
I’m so proud of these Americans. Truly shows what it means to take advantage of the freedom afforded to you!! ❤❤ Thanks Gentlmen
&quot;I&#39;m basically Oprah&quot; - Mark dont compare yourself to Oprah, you&#39;re way better.
It&#39;s not an &quot;extender&quot;, it&#39;s a collimator...
50 тысяч лукасов на 50 милионов сабов. Ничего они не понимают в хорошем контенте)
nile red isn’t here :(
the boat round was rigged towards the laser because it didn&#39;t require projectile accuracy
I love these(remember acid,lava...)
Bro started to become brain rot like Mr beast...
I feel like this is something mrbeast would do
<b>after last challenge someone donate to team seas</b>
I&#39;m happy to see other science YouTubers but i can&#39;t help but feel like this is just an imitation of Mr Beast
so much fun :)   loved it..  go lava !!!

kevin&#39;s spinning lava for lighting the matchsticks was the coolest one IMO
im early
Kevin&#39;s popcorn had greater accuracy.
LOVE the Thunder cats Shirt
Mark rober can sell this video as stock VFX fire lol
Только олды видели старое превью❤
You should be a college science teacher for a whole day only using crunchlabs
I would go to camp crunch labs but I’m already going to a real inperson engineering camp
Is this a show for kids or for idiots?
Laser v dynamite
Mark Rober has officially been Mr.Beastified
Mark pazhalusta take off a colaba with mamix he is Russian but also most obscene videos about science
I feel like his videos are more targeted towards kids now. It is getting less entertaining to watch, the physics aspect just disappears altogether given everything he talks about is covered in the high school curriculum.
Thank for like this video ❤❤❤
🎉
Me
Being precise with catapults is next to impossible
I&#39;m sorry, but this feels like average, soulless YouTube content for bored teenagers. When did Mark Rober become MrBeast? 🤔

Yoooo more group videos let&#39;s go.
Shouldve used a trebuchet kevin...
i would like to know when the backyard scientist (aka Kevin) will make more videos
I am sorry because I am from India ( It cost over Rs. 2000 to Rs. 5000 😢
500k in 1 hour? bro fell off😮😢
My brain barely understands how heat makes rock into liquid. 😅
ein Kommentar
Sir, sir, sir! Where are you and your friends just getting random amounts of lava? Who is just randomly selling lava to the public to play with LMAO 🤣
Usually I&#39;d admit I&#39;ve outgrown the target audience but this time it definitely feels like it&#39;s the other way around
Algernon?
You should invite Mike Shake to your lab 🔥
This is literally a video with so many iconic people 😄
I can tell Mark been workin the upper body<br>Arms chest neck all thicker than the last vid
do they ship the crunchlabs stuff to europe?
P.S. because I am &quot;that&quot; guy, they did use a laser to pop popcorn in the movie Real Genius. Granted, that was a movie though so you guys absolutely win. BTW, thanks for another fun, informative video!

I miss the days when mark rober videos weren’t one big advertisement
This channel changed over time to become the collecting views type instead of the Purposeful engineering
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=122">2:02</a> forgot about that thing 😂😢😂😂😂😂😂😂😢

УРА НОВОЕ ВИДЕОООООООО!
wow
Mark, the challenge is valid in Brazil
I have a small issue in that the &quot;lava&quot; ain&#39;t technically lava because its missing all the ingredients.<br><br>It&#39;s like making a cup of tea without the tea.
Only real mark fans ignore bot comments and move on
MAAAARK❤❤
Shoulda collabed with the dude from the ActionLab channel as well, hes such a cool dude and makes really dope videos that really get me interested in science like you do!!!!👍💯
hiiiiiii
As a guy who grew up, with one of his father boats looking like that yellow tri hull, seeing this hurts.
I think the question should be energy for energy... There is a lot of energy stored in lava..  If you put the same energy into a laser, what results would you get?
mark! we love to see it, ty sir!

the fact they put a red dot sight on a laser just murdered me
Lvl 3 lava wins!
why is mark kinda buff now?
I was totally expecting Styropyto 😭
I think lazers but I could be wrong!
His videos are just becoming less and less educational
Fishes on that lake 😢😢😢😢
That&#39;s what he gets for using a catapult instead of a trebuchet
The quality of this video is top notch! Great work, editing, ideas, awesome creators. This is premium content Mark keep it up!
but did he clean up the lake?
This one is way better than the first one so far 😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=285">4:45</a> who else wanted to taste it 😭
Great video lava omelet
bro became scientificaly MrBeast
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😁😁👍🏻👍🏻
&quot;you look like a chef from the future.&quot; HE IS.
The obvious answer: It completely depends on how powerful of a laser, and what kind of lava/how much. Lava from different material will be different temperatures obviously
Did mark really bring a popcorn cooker to an esoteric popcorn cooking competition..?
I rate the vidio hamburger rank

I&#39;m sorry but it feels a little unfair that he used a popcorn cooking device for the popcorn popping challenge...

This is a nod to the Hawaii suspicions fires that people said was a lazar attack hmmm he’s part of them

а озеро очистили?😢
What about battery acid?
Lava laser confirmed
Ahhhh, I love these kind of experiments you wish you could do as a kid. Who am I kidding. I wish I could do this now.
Should have invited Spyropyro for the laser job. No one lasers better than he does.

Anyone watching in 2024?? From planet earth?
What happened to engineering on this channel? The last few videos remind me of 2016 yt<br>I have a feeling its now more about targeting kids for engagement so there are more crunch sales<br>😑
&quot;Just like grandma makes it..&quot;     &quot; Smells like Grandma..&quot;  - That was hilarious XD
Does anyone know if there&#39;s an update about the Crunchlab boxes? We stopped receiving them after February&#39;s. When I checked my account, the next packages say they haven&#39;t shipped yet 🤷‍♀️
there was not enough safety measures for a channel for kids
THUNDERCATS! Nice shirt Mark!
Mark Rober really pulled out a Fuga
Why would I have experienced cooking ramen noodles on mount Everest Mark?

А тут много англичан среди русских
انا من اشد معجبيك
Love these videos because you can tell mark is super happy making these
I like this video
Mark got pumped up 👍
Wait so that laser can be considered as a DEW just at a micro level?
Я русский
This looks so awesome, an idea for another one of these videos could be Nature vs science. Like animal strenght vs some science thing and so on
amazing as always
Well it all comes down to what ur doing. Lava is better at mass destruction while lasers are for more precise cuts

СЭР, ДА, СЭР!
Thanks for accualy using rocks and not calling melted copper lava
Lasers, spinning swords, catapulting lava.. and somehow those shorts stole the show
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=645">10:45</a>  сэр да сэр!!!! 😍😍😍😍
I&#39;m the first kenyan and probably the only one here. Prove me wrong.
СЕР ДА СЕР
Mice don&#39;t actually like cheese that much. Should have used peanut butter.
Skwiki being given a VIP tube got me
Flying lava strands are amazing to see despite being distracted by the primal fear they inspire.
Lava wins Kevin-4, Bob-2, mark-2
I was going to make a Jujutsu Kaisen reference, but Mark missed every single flaming arrow.
Kevin wouldn’t have had any issues in the last round if he’d have gone with the trebuchet instead of the catapult smh
Are you going to make an automatic bow-and-arrow-inator? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1332">22:12</a>
Um, did you clean the lake after the video?
i got bored of this one fast.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=663">11:03</a> smells like grandma 💀
Thank you for showing me laser death beams are real
Without spoiling too much, The two SPINNING ones were absolutely jaw dropping.

Oh yeah
awesome mark!
i would really love to go to the camp crunchlabs but i speak french not english 😭😕
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1437">23:57</a> The ending was so sad
Hello mark rober do you mind saying happy birthday to me? 🎉😊
Please do more of these videos they&#39;re 🔥🔥🔥
Jimmy K. Lol. 🗑 show
Why is everyone effin&#39; screamin&#39;??
I love how mark tried to give himself a viking funeral

we going back to 2019 youtube with this one.
Lava Lasers Would Probably not work until 2525...
Hello, I&#39;m from Venezuela, greetings
Today on Mark Rober&#39;s Crunch Labs: boys beeing boys
Marks production quality just gets better and better❤
&quot;people look up to you mark&quot; LMAO
Nice i like how you are wearing a echo shirt do you play wow mark rober?
I knew the video was new
Hello
Kevin really spilled the beans with this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=895">14:55</a> I like that
Never would I see lava have beans explode out of a can at highway speeds
Is there a age limit to crunch labs
Every like i get on this comment I&#39;ll study for 1 hour
1 hours = 400k views
I feel like syropyro would make  for a better representation of the laser community
I keep thinking soon they will have a competition with Mark Robber, Smarter EveryDay, and Mr. Beast, and the other kid that makes crazy stuff in his basement.

Wouldn&#39;t the lava flying out of the pot be from inertia, not centripetal force?

The obvious answer: It completely depends on how powerful of a laser, and what kind of lava/how much. Lava from different material will be different temperatures obviously

Can you test unsinkable ship and how does it work
I kinda hoped you would do a collab with the navy or weapons manufacturer and get one of those 300KW or the newer 500KW lasers to play with. In a controlled test environment of course lol.
the air glow from that IR laser is insane
So entertaining and also see you at Open Sauce!! :)

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1202">20:02</a> pretty sure that&#39;s how that works
Thank you for the video,  but we actually would rather prefer more informative content, than these &quot;Mr Beast&quot; like videos, where you destroy staff.<br>Also: did you clean up after those shots? Was the boat taken out the water after it sank? This whole video your were wasting resources that could otherwise be used for their purpose, and thats what I am feeling bad about

My guess is lasers
Love you mark❤
Hi
I don&#39;t want to be that person, cause I really liked the video and it was fun... But I do disagree with dumping a bunch of crucibles and plastic arrows and sinking a boat into a lake. I kind of hope you cleaned up after that, at least for what&#39;s humanly possible to recover? (I don&#39;t expect the remains of the boat to go anywhere). Most of the time I don&#39;t worry about the ecological impact of Mark&#39;s videos cause I think he cares about that, but here I would have liked some reassurance in the video itself.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=1201">20:01</a> yeah that&#39;s usually how hits and misses and go.
48 mins ago???
I hope they cleaned up that lake
mark is the only youtuber that doesnt make u uncomfortable angaging so much with children xD
We in Ukraine love you and your team very much, Mark Rober, we wish you all the best and further success, and also how do you like the idea of testing the most powerful lasers in the world, and what can they cut?
If this gets top comment I will pour lava on my phone
Mark Rober videos now has a element of Mr Beast now hahahahaha
It is the timing of this that makes it suspicious. It is after just a few days of to the specific group of people leakage secret Russian laser technology. I would not say this for if you in a reasonable period of time could not get a sight of it. Truthfully, this video is about the topic of the channel and further follows the pattern of it, also that you are unlikely to get access of such, laser technology, information, and probably so that the creation of the video was in time longer than is the staleness of the information.
Did somebody clean the pond?
most destuctive is water
the spinning lava bucket was my favorite even though it didn&#39;t light anything. It made art!!

واو تجربه مجنونه عاش استمر
what if laser vs high speed water
hello
hey mark I&#39;m an Australian am I still able to go to crunch labs?
E
We in Ukraine love you and your team very much, Mark Rober, we wish you all the best and further success, and also how do you like the idea of testing the most powerful lasers in the world, and what can they cut?
Lava time needs to be taken in to the time to melt rocks
how much time did it take this guy to make this?
If I had a nickel for every channel I follow that showed off the Chinese pressure popcorn popper this week, I’d have 2 nickels. Which isn’t a lot, but it’s odd that it happened twice
Facts: Lava has a temperature greater than 900C° between 1600C° which can be irritable when connecting with other matter. Every minute that passes, the lava becomes carbonized because it is a gaseous matter.
hello mark rober I&#39;m your fans, from Indonesia 🤩🤩🇮🇩🇮🇩
Such amazing scientific discoveries as always.

Yippeeee im under 1 hour
This is the kind of video you expect from 2016 and it’s so nostalgic and awsome
I was hoping for styropyro
Finally he makes a new video
Hi

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=462">7:42</a> &quot;There is no way she is fitting in that.&quot; What an astute observation
We in Ukraine love you and your team very much, Mark Rober, we wish you all the best and further success, and also how do you like the idea of testing the most powerful lasers in the world, and what can they cut?
WHERE TF IS STYROPYRO AT YOU DID MY BOY DIRTY
before i watch the video, my hypothesis is that lasers are more powerful since it’s concentrated light and can generate more heat.
Mark didn&#39;t pull the arrow perfectly
nooooooooooooooo you should have brought styropyro to use his overpowered lasers.
Love the vids Mark! So educational and fun.
Thumbs down for forcing people to look at a guy with no pants.  Is this channel kid friendly?  Don&#39;t be the next MJ Mark!
ONLY REAL MARK FANS CAN LIKE THIS ❤❤❤❤❤
I was here
1405
lol Mark has let himself go, hes GETTING FHATT!!!!
Always amazing when I see Kevin and will on here. Such awesome channels they have. Also super sad I can&#39;t make it to open sauce but I&#39;m excited it&#39;s happening.
i don&#39;t want that boat was funny😂😂😂
I don&#39;t live in America and I want to be an engineer, what should I do? There is nothing in Turkish.why turkish😭😭😭😭

Yo
I REALIZED MARKS SHIRT IS A DRAGON IN THE SHAPE OF THE CRUNCH LABS
No, you don&#39;t need to like this comment.
Is it just me or did mark gain some muscles?
For every subscriber I gain from this comment, I will do 2 push ups
we need to see what the lava did to the floor!!!!!!

Should have had styropyro on!!!!
get nigel
I love how it just became a William Osman video as soon as he showed up, and then just went back.
I was expecting to see the laser king styropyro
There is no way she is fitting in this maze 💀🗣️
Hi
I’m mark as well<br>and I approve this video 🥹❤
Under hour crew
Hi
I would say lava but lasers have range

Obviously the answer is lasers. look at Maui.
What ever lasers destroyed Maui.. that’s whats more power full
6 mins 22k is amazing😊
Markrober Sar Ke Kaun Kaun Video Dekhna Jahta he Like kro😮🎉😊❤😅
жаль что я не знаю английский язык и живу в России 😢
You’re the <b>only</b> reason why I like science
someday somebody is gonna find those ships and manequins and wonder what the heck people were doing in 2024
Olá você é americano passando para falar que você é uma inspiração para os novos engenheiros aqui no Brasil <br>Sou engenheiro elétrico levo você como uma inspiração 😁👍🤜
This is basically nature vs scientific discovery
I like is = 1 min study ❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=358">5:58</a> 😂😂😂❤
im waiting for international shipping
this is amazing
When Mark Rober speaks, I sit down and listen.
My guy is gaining weight
Traducir texto con la cámara<br><br>hello mark rober you are great doing experiments you have to carry like mr.beast and fede mark bro
You&#39;d basically boil yourself in the vacuum of space. How can these space suits possibly keep their fluffy shape if you put them in a vacuum? Kids, think for yourself. Ask questions. Make these adults give solid answers. Keep in mind, they are just regurgitating info from a school system designed by the Rockefeller family.
Styropyro woulda been way more entertaining for the &quot;laser guy&quot;
This was so entertaining 😂 I really loved the science but the humor was 🧑‍🍳 😘
how
&quot;But, I don&#39;t want that boat :(&quot;
Next video idea: lazar vs electricity
First Hour Lets GOOOO!!!!

Mark rober kayak beda sih muka nya di banding yang dulu lebih gedean sekarang, kaget sy pas liat ni Vid kek bukan mark😅
The age of the target audiency is still on the decline as it seems
Its always a great day when Mark Rober uploads
😂
Well played Sir, well played.
Love these new types of videos, very fun
&#39;&#39;But, I don&#39;t want that boat&#39;&#39; 😅
how did they break obsidian without a diamond pickaxe
If you do one of these again, you should bring Dude Perfect as one of your x factors
Open sauce? that&#39;s A W E S O M E  S A U C E
Mark makes the best videos in the world
Mes. Gusto. El video  sienpre tus. videos son divertidos

Wonderful video!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25N0R1KnXVs&amp;t=462">7:42</a> 💀
yooo Mark Rober upload, big W
mark rober. thats who i owe my science/engineering grades.
Simple answer me
I am excited!! I love your videos Mark!! 🌸
Mark rober why
Mark&#39;s videos just keep getting better and better
Can you plz silence the original voices on the different language tracks it distracts and sound like a bad made shopping commercial ?
Yeah, where is Styropyro? He is smarter than Will and Keven combined 10 times over. I get so happy when he has a new video. Never disappointing.
SKIBIDI TOILET.
And here I wish I lived in America
Bro told little kids how to make lava 💀
The can of beans blast and the spinning swords devastation; it just doesn&#39;t get any better than that.😆😂
Muy cool😎✌
The spinning swords is a small version of the @howridiculous Team.... Still nice 😀
😮
Early! Love from the Philippines!!❤
Watch mark come in with a home made nuke in the next video...
Why women live longer than men
Mark looks like he’s bulking up - I see you!
y’all are actual crazy scientists and I love it
Should’ve been styropyro… 😢
Lava vs laser? nah, larva win 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
People here before thirty minutes <br>👇
Why did you turn into MrBest? Dose you hired his production team or something
I swear mark never runs out of ideas
Nice
cool
A laser with the power of the sun probably wins
Inka Kaun Kaun video dekh raha hai like karo bhai
Primero
Who is watching from India?/ कौन कौन भारत से देख रहा है?🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳❤🙏
For a few years I lived in Leadville, Colorado, the highest incorporated city in the world (Elevation 10,200 feet). That is where I learned how to use a pressure cooker to cook a lot of food. Dry beans on the stove in a regular pot? You could let them boil for three weeks and they would still be hard. You might be able to boil a potato...if you have a day. Aside: I really, really enjoyed the older now squirrel obstacle courses.
Firing a flaming arrow at a boat is Viking, not Medieval
3000 watts?<br><b>you can do better than that</b>
I want  likes for no reason
So many bots in this comment section🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Mark I am a huge fan and I just don&#39;t get these lava vs. videos. They do not fall under the normal very scientific and educational content I became to expect. This is more something Kevin would do on his channel. I get kids love this but you are comparing apples to oranges. Where is the actual science. I have not been to thrilled with the most recent content that I look forward to seeing. You can do better.
I really like that this is becoming a shown now with William as a ref ^^

Is 10k likes in 24 minutes of posting something a record? It feels like it should be. 100k views in that time seems crazy as well.
very cool
24 min ago wow!
The channel&#39;s insurance rates definitely went up after this video.
get styropyro on board. he makes possibly the craziest contraptions out of all the science related youtubers, and specializes in lasers
WHAT a laser episode without @brainiac75. the horror. 😔

Who is under 10 minutes
Im calling rigged before i fully watch the video i call rigged because its not styropyro
hi mark, i&#39;m from vietnam, i watch many shows about pyramids and ancient egyptian mysteries, i&#39;m curious about how intricately carved stone structures are, and i have an idea to cook melt the stones to pour them into a mold of any shape, let them cool, separate them and polish them with sandpaper, maybe we will find out the mystery of how the ancient Egyptians sculpted statues or chisels. giant blocks of rock, there is a guy who specializes in lava, I hope you will make a clip about the issue I mentioned, thank you, a fan from Vietnam
Guys a new mark rober video and a promised McLaren Ferrari fight I am loving this night
Mark rober is best youtubers
I wonder when actual science/engineering videos are coming back. These are just OG Mr beast videos

wow
i am love you Mark Rober
can you not make meaningless uninspired content like some other channels with &#39;LAVA ON IPHONE&#39; and such, seriously, making unique building projects or conducting expierenments while learning something was what made you, you
They both destroy things with heat, so they&#39;re equal?
first 10 minutes!!!!
joined at 8 mins
Making a lazer video without styropyro seems like a crime
Using something designed to pop popcorn in a popcorn popping competition seems like cheating lol

Hi
This content is so Mark Rober😂
I feel like this could be answered simply by calculating the power density of the laser and lava... but who would want to watch that? :D
Honestly loving the new content, keep going!

I can answer this without even watching the video!<br>Lava is unaffected by lasers, lava can break up a laserbeam.<br>Case closed.
The goblins shall fuel the revolution.

Lasers are hot! But lava is even hotter!

Was hoping for StyroPyro and his lasers
Before even starting the video i can conclude that it depends on other things, like how strong is the lazer, how much lava we have, what the surface area is etc etc.
i will be the most liked comment
